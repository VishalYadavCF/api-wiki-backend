## API Endpoint Documentation: Session Token Generation

### 1. Endpoint Overview

*   **Endpoint Path**: `/api/v1/auth/token/exchange`
*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Consumes**: `application/json`
*   **Produces**: `application/json`
*   **Controller Method Name**: `AuthenticationController.exchangeCodeForTokens`
*   **Primary Function**: This endpoint is responsible for exchanging a temporary, single-use authorization code (obtained from an external Identity Provider, IdP) for application-specific access and refresh tokens. It establishes a secure session for the user within the application, setting necessary authentication cookies.

### 2. Request and Response

**Request Type**:
The request body is a JSON object containing the temporary authorization code received from the external Identity Provider.

*   **Payload Structure**:
    ```json
    {
      "authorizationCode": "some_temporary_auth_code_from_idp",
      "redirectUri": "https://your.app.com/callback" // Optional, but often required for IdP validation
    }
    ```
*   **Input Parameters**:
    *   `authorizationCode` (String, Required): A one-time code received from the external Identity Provider.
    *   `redirectUri` (String, Optional): The URI to which the IdP redirected the user after authentication. Used for validation against the registered redirect URI.

**Response Type**:
A JSON object containing the access token and its expiry, and details of the refresh token. Additionally, secure HTTP-only cookies are set for session management.

*   **Success Response (HTTP 200 OK)**:
    *   **Payload Structure**:
        ```json
        {
          "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1Ni...", // JWT access token
          "expiresIn": 3600,                    // Access token validity in seconds (e.g., 1 hour)
          "tokenType": "Bearer",
          "refreshTokenId": "some_unique_refresh_token_id" // Identifier for the refresh token
        }
        ```
    *   **Headers**:
        *   `Set-Cookie`:
            *   `accessToken`: Contains the JWT access token.
            *   `refreshToken`: Contains the JWT refresh token.
            *   Both cookies are configured with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Lax` (or `Strict` depending on requirements).
    *   **Cookies**:
        *   `accessToken`: `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Path=/`, `Max-Age=3600` (matches `expiresIn`).
        *   `refreshToken`: `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Path=/auth/refresh`, `Max-Age=604800` (e.g., 7 days).

### 3. Call Hierarchy

The following outlines the sequential flow of operations and method calls when `AuthenticationController.exchangeCodeForTokens` is invoked:

1.  **`AuthenticationController.exchangeCodeForTokens(ExchangeCodeRequest request)`**
    *   **Purpose**: Entry point for the token exchange process.
    *   **Inputs**: `ExchangeCodeRequest` DTO containing `authorizationCode` and `redirectUri`.
    *   **Operations**:
        *   **Input Validation**: Performs initial validation of the `ExchangeCodeRequest` (e.g., checks for `null` or empty `authorizationCode`).
        *   **Delegates**: Calls `AuthenticationService.processAuthorizationCode(request.getAuthorizationCode(), request.getRedirectUri())`.

2.  **`AuthenticationService.processAuthorizationCode(String code, String redirectUri)`**
    *   **Purpose**: Orchestrates the core logic for validating the authorization code and generating tokens.
    *   **Inputs**: `authorizationCode`, `redirectUri`.
    *   **Operations**:
        *   **IdP Integration**:
            *   Calls an `ExternalIdentityProviderClient.exchangeCodeForUserIdentity(code, redirectUri)` to communicate with the external IdP.
            *   **External Service Call**: Makes an HTTP POST request to the IdP's token endpoint, exchanging the `authorizationCode` for user identity information (e.g., user ID, email).
            *   **Output**: Receives `UserIdentity` (DTO/model) from the IdP.
        *   **User Provisioning/Retrieval**:
            *   Calls `UserService.findOrCreateUser(userIdentity)`:
                *   **Database Operation**: Attempts to find an existing user in the local `User` database table based on the `userIdentity`.
                *   **Database Operation**: If the user does not exist, a new user record is created in the `User` table.
                *   **Output**: Returns `User` entity.
        *   **Token Generation**:
            *   Calls `TokenService.generateAccessToken(user.getUserId(), user.getRoles())`:
                *   **JWT Creation**: Generates a new JWT access token signed with the application's private key, embedding `userId` and `roles` as claims.
                *   **Output**: Returns `accessToken` (String).
            *   Calls `TokenService.generateRefreshToken(user.getUserId())`:
                *   **JWT Creation**: Generates a new JWT refresh token.
                *   **Database Operation**: Stores the refresh token's unique ID and associated `userId` in the `RefreshToken` database table (for revocation/management).
                *   **Output**: Returns `refreshToken` (String) and `refreshTokenId` (String).
        *   **Session Management**:
            *   Calls `SessionService.createOrUpdateUserSession(user.getUserId(), refreshTokenId)`:
                *   **Database Operation**: Creates a new session record or updates an existing one in the `UserSession` table, linking it to the `userId` and `refreshTokenId`.
        *   **Cookie Generation**:
            *   Calls `CookieService.createAuthCookies(accessToken, refreshToken)`:
                *   Constructs `HttpCookie` objects for the `accessToken` and `refreshToken` with appropriate security flags (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`).
                *   **Output**: Returns a `List<HttpCookie>`.
        *   **Response Construction**: Constructs and returns a `TokenExchangeResponse` DTO containing `accessToken`, `expiresIn`, and `refreshTokenId`.

### 4. Key Operations

1.  **Authorization Code Exchange**: Communicates with an external Identity Provider (IdP) to validate the one-time authorization code and obtain user identity information. This is crucial for federated authentication.
2.  **User Provisioning/Retrieval**: Checks if the user exists in the application's local user store. If not, it provisions a new user account based on the identity provided by the IdP, ensuring new users can access the system.
3.  **Access Token Generation**: Creates a short-lived JSON Web Token (JWT) signed by the application, embedding user-specific claims (e.g., user ID, roles). This token is used for subsequent authenticated API calls.
4.  **Refresh Token Generation and Storage**: Generates a longer-lived JWT refresh token. Crucially, its ID is stored in a database, allowing for server-side revocation and better session control. This enables the user to obtain new access tokens without re-authenticating frequently.
5.  **Session Management**: Records the active user session in the database, linking it to the refresh token. This provides visibility into active sessions and supports forced logouts.
6.  **Secure Cookie Management**: Constructs and sets HTTP-only, secure cookies for both the access and refresh tokens. This is a critical security measure to prevent client-side JavaScript access to tokens, reducing XSS attack vectors.
7.  **Input Validation**: Ensures that the incoming request payload is well-formed and contains valid data, preventing common vulnerabilities and malformed requests.

### 6. Security Features

*   **JWT Security**:
    *   **Signed Tokens**: Both access and refresh tokens are JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) signed using a strong cryptographic algorithm (e.g., HS256 or RS256) and a securely stored private key, ensuring their integrity and authenticity.
    *   **Expiration**: Access tokens are short-lived (e.g., 1 hour) to minimize the impact of token compromise. Refresh tokens are longer-lived (e.g., 7 days) but can be revoked.
    *   **Audience/Issuer/Subject Claims**: JWTs include standard claims like `aud` (audience), `iss` (issuer), and `sub` (subject/user ID) to ensure they are used by the intended recipient and issued by the legitimate server.
*   **Cookie Security**:
    *   **`HttpOnly`**: Both `accessToken` and `refreshToken` cookies are marked `HttpOnly`, preventing client-side JavaScript from accessing them, mitigating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
    *   **`Secure`**: Cookies are marked `Secure`, ensuring they are only sent over HTTPS connections, protecting against Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
    *   **`SameSite`**: Cookies are set with `SameSite=Lax` (or `Strict` for higher security), preventing them from being sent with cross-site requests, mitigating Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of the `authorizationCode` and `redirectUri` to prevent injection attacks and ensure only valid requests are processed.
*   **CORS Handling**: The API likely has a configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy to allow only trusted frontend domains to access it, preventing unauthorized cross-origin requests.
*   **Refresh Token Revocation**: The refresh token's ID is stored in the database, allowing administrators or users to revoke specific sessions (e.g., "log out from all devices"), providing a mechanism for session control beyond JWT expiry.
*   **External IdP Communication Security**: Communication with the external Identity Provider occurs over HTTPS, and client credentials/secrets are securely managed (e.g., environment variables, secret management systems).

### 7. Error Handling

*   **Centralized Exception Handling**: The application uses a global exception handler (e.g., Spring's `@ControllerAdvice`) to catch and process various exceptions.
*   **Error Types**:
    *   **Invalid Input (HTTP 400 Bad Request)**: If `authorizationCode` is missing or malformed, or `redirectUri` is invalid.
    *   **Authentication Failure (HTTP 401 Unauthorized/403 Forbidden)**: If the IdP rejects the `authorizationCode`, indicating an invalid or expired code, or if the user identity cannot be verified.
    *   **Internal Server Error (HTTP 500 Internal Server Error)**: For unexpected issues such as database connection failures, errors during JWT signing, or unhandled exceptions from the IdP client.
*   **Logging**: All errors are logged at appropriate levels (e.g., `WARN` for client errors, `ERROR` for server errors) with sufficient context (stack traces, request IDs) to aid debugging.
*   **Error Response Structure**: Errors are returned to the client in a consistent JSON format:
    ```json
    {
      "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:30:00Z",
      "status": 400,
      "error": "Bad Request",
      "message": "Authorization code is required.",
      "path": "/api/v1/auth/token/exchange"
    }
    ```
*   **Custom Exceptions**: Specific business logic errors (e.g., `InvalidAuthorizationCodeException`) are mapped to appropriate HTTP status codes by the exception handler.

### 8. Performance Considerations

*   **Optimized Token Generation**: JWT generation is a computationally efficient process, typically involving cryptographic signing that adds minimal overhead.
*   **Database Query Optimization**: User lookup and refresh token storage operations are optimized with appropriate indexing on `user_id` and `token_id` columns to ensure fast database interactions.
*   **External IdP Latency**: The primary performance bottleneck might be the round-trip latency to the external Identity Provider. This is an external dependency, and its performance directly impacts this endpoint's response time. Caching IdP metadata (if applicable) can reduce some overhead.
*   **Minimal Cookie Size**: The JWTs are designed to be compact, minimizing the size of HTTP cookies, which reduces request/response overhead for subsequent calls.
*   **Metrics Collection**: The endpoint is instrumented with metrics (e.g., using Micrometer/Prometheus) to monitor response times, error rates, and throughput, allowing for performance bottlenecks to be identified and addressed.

### 9. Usage Pattern

This endpoint is typically the second step in an OAuth2/OIDC Authorization Code Flow.

*   **Prerequisite**: A user must have successfully authenticated with an external Identity Provider (e.g., Google, Okta, Auth0). Upon successful authentication, the IdP redirects the user's browser back to the application's designated `redirect_uri` with a temporary `authorizationCode` as a query parameter.
*   **Typical Flow**:
    1.  The frontend application (e.g., a Single Page Application) receives the `authorizationCode` from the URL query parameters.
    2.  The frontend immediately makes a `POST` request to this `/api/v1/auth/token/exchange` endpoint, passing the `authorizationCode` and `redirectUri` in the request body.
    3.  This endpoint then handles the server-side exchange with the IdP, generates application-specific tokens, sets secure cookies, and returns a minimal success response to the frontend.
    4.  The user is now authenticated within the application, and subsequent API calls can be made using the provided `accessToken` (either from the response body or retrieved from the cookie by the browser).

### 10. Additional Notes

*   **Stateless Access Tokens, Stateful Refresh Tokens**: This implementation utilizes stateless access tokens (JWTs) for API authorization, meaning the server does not need to look up anything for validation. However, refresh tokens are managed statefully in the database, allowing for explicit revocation and enhanced security.
*   **Configurable Token Lifetimes**: The lifetimes of access and refresh tokens are configurable parameters, allowing administrators to adjust them based on security policies and user experience requirements.
*   **IdP Configuration**: Proper configuration of the external Identity Provider (client ID, client secret, authorized redirect URIs) is paramount for this endpoint's functionality. These secrets are securely stored and accessed by the `ExternalIdentityProviderClient`.
*   **Scalability**: The design separates concerns (token generation, user management, session management) into distinct services, promoting modularity and facilitating independent scaling of components.
