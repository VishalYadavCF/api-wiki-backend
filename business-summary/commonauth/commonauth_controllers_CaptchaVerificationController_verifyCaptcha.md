    *   **`SameSite` (e.g., `Lax` or `Strict`)**: `[Explanation, e.g., Provides robust protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by restricting when cookies are sent with cross-site requests. 'Lax' allows GET requests from other sites (e.g., navigation), while 'Strict' prevents almost all cross-site cookie sending.]`
*   **CORS Handling**: `[Description, e.g., Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies are strictly configured to permit requests only from authorized frontend domains, preventing unauthorized websites from making requests to this API.]`
*   **Secure Refresh Token Storage**: `[Description, e.g., Refresh tokens are not stored directly in client storage (e.g., localStorage) but are securely persisted in the backend database (likely hashed or encrypted) and associated with the user, enhancing the overall session security.]`
*   *(Add any other security features observed or inferred, like rate limiting, TLS usage, etc.)*

## 7. Error Handling

The endpoint employs a robust error handling strategy to provide clear feedback to clients, protect sensitive information, and maintain system stability:

*   **Types of Errors Handled**:
    *   **Invalid Input / Bad Request (HTTP 400)**: `[Description, e.g., Occurs when the client provides malformed requests or data that fails validation checks (e.g., missing required fields, invalid format of the external token).]`
    *   **Authentication Failure / Unauthorized (HTTP 401)**: `[Description, e.g., Triggered specifically when the external token validation fails (e.g., the external token is expired, invalid, or forged).]`
    *   **Resource Not Found (HTTP 404)**: `[Description, e.g., Less likely for this endpoint's primary flow, but could occur if internal lookup dependencies (e.g., a specific user not found in the system when it should exist) are not handled or a misconfiguration occurs.]`
    *   **Internal Server Error (HTTP 500)**: `[Description, e.g., Catches unexpected exceptions within the service layer (e.g., database connectivity issues, unhandled runtime errors during token generation or storage). These errors are typically logged for internal review.]`
*   **Error Reporting**:
    *   **Logging**: `[Description, e.g., All errors are comprehensively logged at appropriate severity levels (e.g., WARN for client-side issues, ERROR for system failures) including stack traces and contextual information, aiding in debugging and operational monitoring.]`
    *   **Client Response**: `[Description, e.g., Errors are consistently transformed into standardized JSON error responses for the client. These responses typically include an error code, a developer-friendly message, and an appropriate HTTP status code to clearly communicate the issue.]`
    *   **Exception Handling Mechanism**: `[Description, e.g., A global exception handler (e.g., Spring's @ControllerAdvice) is used to centrally manage exceptions, mapping them to specific HTTP status codes and uniform error structures, ensuring consistency across the API.]`
    *   **Sensitive Data Masking**: `[Description, e.g., Sensitive information (e.g., raw tokens, internal error details) is never exposed in error responses returned to the client.]`

## 8. Performance Considerations

Optimizations and monitoring practices are in place to ensure the endpoint performs efficiently and scales effectively:

*   **Efficient Token Generation**: `[Description, e.g., The process of generating and signing JWTs is highly optimized, leveraging efficient cryptographic libraries and pre-configured signing parameters to minimize CPU overhead and response time.]`
*   **Optimized Database Operations**: `[Description, e.g., Database interactions for user lookup and refresh token storage are designed for efficiency, utilizing indexed fields to ensure rapid retrieval and persistence even under high load. Operations are often non-blocking where applicable.]`
*   **Minimal Response Payload**: `[Description, e.g., The success response payload is intentionally kept very lean (e.g., just a status indicator). This reduces network bandwidth consumption and speeds up client-side processing, contributing to lower overall latency.]`
*   **Cookie Size Management**: `[Description, e.g., While JWTs carry data, their size is kept in check to avoid excessive HTTP header overhead, which can impact performance, especially on high-traffic endpoints.]`
*   **Metrics Collection**: `[Description, e.g., Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as average response time, request throughput, and error rates are collected and monitored using internal observability tools. This enables proactive identification and resolution of performance bottlenecks.]`
*   *(Add any other performance-related details, e.g., caching, asynchronous operations if applicable)*

## 9. Usage Pattern

This endpoint is typically used in the following scenario as a critical part of the user authentication and session establishment process:

*   **Scenario**: `[Detailed description of the use case, e.g., This endpoint is specifically designed to be called by a client application (e.g., a web or mobile frontend) immediately after a user has successfully authenticated with an **external Identity Provider (IdP)**, such as Google, Facebook, Okta, or Azure AD.]`
*   **Prerequisites**:
    *   `[Prerequisite 1, e.g., The client application must have completed the OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect flow with the external IdP and successfully obtained an identity token or access token from that IdP.]`
    *   `[Prerequisite 2, e.g., The external IdP's configuration (e.g., public keys, issuer URLs, client IDs) must be correctly set up and trusted by our backend system for token validation.]`
    *   `[Prerequisite 3, e.g., The client needs an active network connection to reach this API endpoint.]`
*   **Typical Flow**: `[Step-by-step description of how the endpoint is used, e.g., The client sends the externally-issued token to this endpoint. Our backend then validates this token, identifies or creates a corresponding local user, generates our application's own set of JWT access and refresh tokens, and finally delivers these tokens to the client via secure HTTP-only cookies. These cookies then establish the user's authenticated session with our application for subsequent API calls.]`
*   **Purpose of Exchange**: `[Explain the why, e.g., The core purpose is to "exchange" the trust established by the external IdP for our system's internal session management tokens, providing a seamless and secure single sign-on (SSO) experience for the user within our application.]`

## 10. Additional Notes

*   **Limitations**: `[Any known limitations, e.g., This endpoint does not support direct username/password authentication; it strictly operates on tokens received from external identity providers.]`
*   **Assumptions**: `[Key assumptions made, e.g., It is assumed that the external Identity Provider adheres to standard token issuance protocols (e.g., OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0) and that its token signing keys are publicly verifiable or configured within our system.]`
*   **Configurations**: `[Specific configurable parameters, e.g., JWT secret keys, token expiration durations, cookie domain and path settings, and CORS allowed origins are all configurable, typically via environment variables or application configuration files.]`
*   **Scalability**: `[Notes on scalability, e.g., Designed to be horizontally scalable, allowing multiple instances to run concurrently behind a load balancer to handle high volumes of token exchange requests.]`
*   **Further Clarification**: `[Guidance for more details, e.g., For in-depth details on JWT claims, cryptographic algorithms used, or specific IdP integration nuances, please refer to the internal security architecture documentation or consult with the authentication team.]`
