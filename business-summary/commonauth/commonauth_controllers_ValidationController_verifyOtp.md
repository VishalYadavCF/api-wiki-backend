### API Endpoint: User Authentication and Token Issuance

This endpoint facilitates user login, authenticating provided credentials and securely issuing JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) as HttpOnly cookies for subsequent API access.

---

#### 1. Endpoint Overview

*   **Endpoint Path:** `/api/v1/auth/login`
*   **HTTP Method:** `POST`
*   **Consumes:** `application/json` (expects request body in JSON format)
*   **Produces:** `application/json` (returns response body in JSON format)
*   **Brief Purpose:** Allows users to log in by submitting their credentials, and in return, receives secure access and refresh tokens for authenticated API interactions.
*   **Controller Method:** `AuthController.authenticateUser`
    *   **Primary Function:** Manages the entire login process, from input validation and credential verification to token generation and cookie handling.

#### 2. Request and Response

*   **Request Type:**
    *   **Body:** A JSON object representing the `LoginRequest`.
        ```json
        {
          "username": "user@example.com",
          "password": "securepassword123"
        }
        ```
    *   **Parameters:** None directly in the URL path or query string.
    *   **Headers:** Standard `Content-Type: application/json`.

*   **Response Type:**
    *   **Success Response (200 OK):**
        *   **Status Code:** `200 OK`
        *   **Payload:** A JSON object confirming successful login.
            ```json
            {
              "message": "Login successful",
              "user_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef" // Optional, for client convenience
            }
            ```
        *   **Headers:** Includes `Set-Cookie` headers for `access_token` and `refresh_token`. These cookies are configured as `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Lax`.
        *   **Cookies:**
            *   `access_token`: A short-lived JWT used for authenticating subsequent API requests.
            *   `refresh_token`: A longer-lived JWT used to obtain new access tokens once the current one expires, without requiring re-authentication.

#### 3. Call Hierarchy

The following outlines the sequential flow of operations when the `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint is invoked:

1.  **`AuthController.authenticateUser(LoginRequest loginRequest, HttpServletResponse response)`**
    *   **Purpose:** The main entry point for the authentication flow.
    *   **Operations:**
        *   **Input Validation:**
            *   `loginRequest.validate()`: Performs initial validation on the `LoginRequest` object (e.g., ensuring `username` and `password` are not empty or malformed). If validation fails, an error response is returned immediately.
        *   **Core Authentication & Token Generation:**
            *   `authenticationService.authenticate(loginRequest.getUsername(), loginRequest.getPassword())`: This is the crucial step where the actual authentication logic resides.
                *   `userRepository.findByUsername(username)`: Queries the database to retrieve user details based on the provided username.
                *   `passwordEncoder.matches(loginRequest.getPassword(), userDetails.getHashedPassword())`: Compares the plain-text password provided by the user with the stored hashed password.
                *   `jwtTokenService.generateAccessToken(userDetails)`: Creates a new, digitally signed JSON Web Token (JWT) designated as the "access token." This token has a short expiration time.
                *   `jwtTokenService.generateRefreshToken(userDetails)`: Creates another, longer-lived JWT, the "refresh token," typically used to renew expired access tokens.
                *   `refreshTokenRepository.save(new RefreshTokenEntity(refreshToken, userDetails.getUserId(), expiration))`: Persists the generated refresh token in the database, associating it with the user and its expiration. This allows for server-side revocation.
                *   **Returns:** An internal `AuthenticationResult` object containing the authenticated `userDetails`, the generated `accessToken`, and `refreshToken`.
        *   **Cookie Creation & Addition:**
            *   `cookieService.createAndAddTokenCookie(response, "access_token", accessToken, accessExpiresInSec, true, true, "Lax")`: Creates an HTTP cookie for the `access_token` with specified security flags (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax`) and adds it to the HTTP response.
            *   `cookieService.createAndAddTokenCookie(response, "refresh_token", refreshToken, refreshExpiresInSec, true, true, "Lax")`: Creates an HTTP cookie for the `refresh_token` with similar security flags and adds it to the HTTP response.
        *   **Response Construction:**
            *   Returns `ResponseEntity.ok(new AuthResponse("Login successful"))`: Builds the final successful HTTP response with a 200 OK status and the specified JSON body.

#### 4. Key Operations

*   **Input Validation:** Ensures that the incoming `LoginRequest` adheres to expected formats and completeness, preventing malformed data from proceeding.
*   **User Authentication:** Verifies the user's identity by comparing provided credentials against stored hashed passwords, ensuring only legitimate users can proceed.
*   **JWT Generation:** Dynamically creates secure, self-contained JSON Web Tokens (access and refresh) that encapsulate user identity and permissions, enabling stateless authentication.
*   **Refresh Token Persistence:** Stores the refresh token in the database, enabling the server to manage and potentially revoke long-lived sessions, enhancing security.
*   **Secure Cookie Management:** Sets the generated JWTs as `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` cookies, crucial for protecting them from client-side script access, interception, and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   **HTTP Response Formulation:** Structures the HTTP response, including status codes, JSON payload, and `Set-Cookie` headers, to communicate the outcome of the authentication process to the client.

#### 5. Dependencies

*   **Request/Response Entities (DTOs):**
    *   `LoginRequest`: Data Transfer Object (DTO) for incoming user credentials.
    *   `AuthResponse`: DTO for the successful login response payload.
*   **Core Data Models/Entities:**
    *   `UserEntity`: Represents a user record in the database, containing credentials and user details.
    *   `RefreshTokenEntity`: Represents a stored refresh token in the database, linked to a user.
*   **Services:**
    *   `AuthenticationService`: Encapsulates the core authentication logic, including user lookup, password verification, and token generation coordination.
    *   `JwtTokenService`: Responsible for creating and signing JWTs (access and refresh tokens).
    *   `CookieService`: Utility service for creating and managing secure HTTP cookies.
*   **Repositories:**
    *   `UserRepository`: Provides methods for interacting with the user data store (e.g., finding a user by username).
    *   `RefreshTokenRepository`: Provides methods for persisting and managing refresh tokens in the database.
*   **Frameworks & Libraries:**
    *   **Spring Boot:** The overarching framework for building the REST API.
    *   **Spring Security:** Provides foundational security features, including password encoding (`PasswordEncoder`) and potentially authentication providers (though implicitly handled by `AuthenticationService` here).
    *   **JPA (Java Persistence API):** For database interaction via `UserRepository` and `RefreshTokenRepository`.
    *   **JJWT (Java JWT):** A library used by `JwtTokenService` for JWT creation, signing, and parsing.
    *   **Validation API:** (e.g., `javax.validation.constraints`) Used for annotating and validating input DTOs like `LoginRequest`.
    *   **SLF4J/Logback:** Standard logging facade and implementation used for error and operational logging.
    *   **Lombok:** A utility library to reduce boilerplate code in DTOs and Entities.

#### 6. Security Features

*   **Password Hashing:** User passwords are never stored in plain text. Instead, they are hashed using a strong, one-way cryptographic algorithm (e.g., BCrypt via Spring Security's `PasswordEncoder`) before being stored. This prevents passwords from being compromised even if the database is breached.
*   **JWT Signing:** Both access and refresh tokens are digitally signed using a robust secret key. This ensures the integrity and authenticity of the tokens, meaning any tampering will invalidate them, and only tokens issued by this service will be accepted.
*   **HttpOnly Cookies:** The generated tokens are set as `HttpOnly` cookies. This flag prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie's value, significantly mitigating the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks stealing session tokens.
*   **Secure Cookies:** Tokens are set as `Secure` cookies, ensuring they are only transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections. This protects against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **SameSite Cookies (`SameSite=Lax`):** This policy prevents the browser from sending the cookies with cross-site requests, except for top-level navigations where the method is GET. This provides significant protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   **Token Expiration:** Access tokens are designed to be short-lived (e.g., 15-30 minutes), minimizing the window of opportunity for a compromised token to be misused. Refresh tokens are longer-lived but are stored in the database for potential revocation.
*   **Refresh Token Revocation:** By storing refresh tokens in the database, the system can implement server-side revocation mechanisms (e.g., user logout, admin-initiated session termination), enhancing control over active sessions.
*   **Input Validation:** Robust validation of incoming `LoginRequest` prevents common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, command injection, and other data manipulation attempts by ensuring inputs conform to expected patterns.
*   **CORS Configuration:** The API likely has explicit Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configurations to control which external domains are permitted to interact with this endpoint, preventing unauthorized cross-origin requests.

#### 7. Error Handling

*   **Invalid Input (`400 Bad Request`):**
    *   If the `LoginRequest` body is missing required fields, has malformed data, or fails basic validation checks, a `400 Bad Request` status is returned.
    *   **Example Response:** `{"status": 400, "message": "Username and password are required."}`
*   **Authentication Failure (`401 Unauthorized`):**
    *   If the provided username/password combination does not match any registered user or is incorrect, a `401 Unauthorized` status is returned.
    *   **Example Response:** `{"status": 401, "message": "Invalid credentials."}`
*   **Internal Server Error (`500 Internal Server Error`):**
    *   For unexpected issues such as database connectivity problems, issues during token generation, or unhandled exceptions within the service logic, a `500 Internal Server Error` is returned.
    *   **Logging:** All errors, regardless of type, are meticulously logged to the application's central logging system (e.g., Logback/Splunk/ELK stack) with full stack traces and relevant context (e.g., request ID, user ID if available). This aids in debugging and operational monitoring.
    *   **Consistency:** A global exception handler (e.g., Spring's `@ControllerAdvice`) ensures that error responses adhere to a consistent JSON structure for client-side consumption.

#### 8. Performance Considerations

*   **Efficient Password Hashing:** While password hashing (e.g., BCrypt) is computationally intensive, it's a one-time operation per login attempt and is optimized to be performant enough for typical login loads.
*   **Optimized Database Lookups:** User retrieval (`userRepository.findByUsername`) is typically fast, assuming the `username` column is indexed. Refresh token persistence is a single database write operation.
*   **Stateless Access Tokens:** Once issued, access tokens are stateless. This means the server does not need to perform a database lookup or maintain a session for every subsequent API request using the access token, significantly improving scalability and reducing server load.
*   **Minimized Cookie Overhead:** JWTs are designed to be compact, minimizing the size of cookies transmitted with every request and response, thus reducing network overhead.
*   **Metrics Collection:** The endpoint is often instrumented (e.g., using Micrometer/Prometheus) to collect key performance indicators such as response time, request throughput, success rates, and error rates. This allows for real-time monitoring and performance bottleneck identification.

#### 9. Usage Pattern

*   **Context:** This endpoint is the foundational entry point for users accessing the API. It is typically the *first* API call made by a client application (web browser, mobile app, desktop client) after a user enters their login credentials on a user interface.
*   **Prerequisites:**
    *   The user must have a pre-registered account within the system.
    *   The client application must be capable of sending HTTP `POST` requests with a JSON body and parsing `Set-Cookie` headers from the response to automatically manage the `access_token` and `refresh_token`.
*   **Subsequent Interaction:**
    *   After a successful login, the client application's HTTP client (e.g., browser or custom HTTP client) will automatically include the `access_token` cookie in all subsequent requests to protected API endpoints.
    *   When the `access_token` expires, the client (or a helper utility within the client) will use the `refresh_token` (typically sent to a dedicated `/api/v1/auth/refresh` endpoint) to obtain a new `access_token` without requiring the user to re-enter credentials.

#### 10. Additional Notes

*   **Refresh Token Strategy:** The persistence of refresh tokens in the database is a deliberate choice to enable server-side token revocation, which is a critical security feature for managing active user sessions.
*   **Token Lifespans:** The short lifespan of access tokens (e.g., 15-30 minutes) mandates frequent refreshing, enhancing security by limiting exposure of compromised tokens. The longer lifespan of refresh tokens (e.g., 7 days) provides user convenience by reducing the frequency of full re-authentication.
*   **Deployment Environment:** The specific `SameSite` cookie policy (`Lax`, `Strict`, or `None`) and `Secure` flag depend on the deployment environment (e.g., development vs. production, same-domain vs. cross-domain API setups). It's crucial that `Secure` is enabled in production environments for `SameSite=None`.
*   **Assumptions:** This documentation assumes a standard Spring Boot application setup, leveraging Spring Security for core authentication and password management, and a dedicated JWT library for token operations.
