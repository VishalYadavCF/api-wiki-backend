## API Endpoint Documentation: `/auth/callback`

### 1. Endpoint Overview

*   **Endpoint Path**: `/auth/callback`
*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Consumes**: `application/json`
*   **Produces**: `application/json`
*   **Purpose**: This endpoint serves as the callback URL for external authentication providers (e.g., OAuth2/OIDC Identity Providers). Its primary function is to process the authentication code received from the external provider, exchange it for tokens, establish a secure user session, and issue internal authentication tokens (JWTs) and relevant cookies to the client.
*   **Controller Method**: `AuthCallbackController.handleAuthCallback`
*   **Primary Function**: Facilitates the final step of an external authentication flow, translating an external authentication success into an internal secure user session and token issuance.

### 2. Request and Response

**Request Type**:
The request is a JSON payload containing the necessary information returned by the external Identity Provider (IdP) after a successful authentication, typically a code that can be exchanged for tokens.

*   **HTTP Headers**:
    *   `Content-Type: application/json`
*   **Payload Structure (AuthCallbackRequest)**:
    ```json
    {
      "authCode": "your_authorization_code_from_idp",
      "redirectUri": "your_original_redirect_uri_to_idp",
      "state": "optional_state_parameter_for_csrf_prevention" // If applicable and used
    }
    ```
    *   `authCode` (String): The authorization code received from the external Identity Provider.
    *   `redirectUri` (String): The `redirect_uri` that was initially used to start the OAuth2/OIDC flow with the external IdP. This is crucial for validation.
    *   `state` (String, optional): An opaque value used to maintain state between the request and the callback. It's often used for CSRF mitigation.

**Response Type**:
A successful response indicates that the user has been successfully authenticated, and the server has established a session and provided the necessary tokens.

*   **Success Response (HTTP Status Code: 200 OK)**:
    *   **Payload Structure (TokenResponse)**:
        ```json
        {
          "message": "Authentication successful",
          "userId": "user_id_from_internal_system",
          "roles": ["USER", "ADMIN"] // Example roles
          // Note: JWTs are typically sent via HttpOnly cookies for security,
          // not directly in the JSON body for access tokens.
          // However, a refresh token might be included in body if it's less sensitive.
        }
        ```
        *   `message` (String): A confirmation message.
        *   `userId` (String): The unique identifier of the user in the internal system.
        *   `roles` (Array of Strings): The roles or permissions assigned to the authenticated user.
    *   **Headers**:
        *   `Content-Type: application/json`
    *   **Cookies (Set-Cookie Headers)**:
        *   `accessToken` (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax): Contains the JWT Access Token.
        *   `refreshToken` (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax): Contains the JWT Refresh Token.
        *   `sessionId` (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax): Contains the JSessionID for server-side session tracking (if enabled).
        *   `XSRF-TOKEN` (Non-HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax): Contains the CSRF token for subsequent requests (used by frontend).

### 4. Key Operations

1.  **Request Validation**: Although not explicitly detailed in the hierarchy, it's implicitly performed on the `AuthCallbackRequest` to ensure the `authCode` and `redirectUri` are present and valid, preventing malformed requests.
2.  **External Token Exchange**: Calls out to the configured external Identity Provider to exchange the provided `authCode` for actual authentication tokens (e.g., ID Token, Access Token) issued by the IdP.
3.  **User Provisioning/Lookup**: Based on the user information from the external IdP's tokens, the system either finds an existing user in its database or creates a new user account if it's their first login. This ensures consistency between external and internal user identities.
4.  **Internal Token Generation**: Creates two types of internal JSON Web Tokens (JWTs):
    *   **Access Token**: Short-lived, used for authenticating subsequent API calls.
    *   **Refresh Token**: Long-lived, used to obtain new access tokens once the current access token expires, reducing the need for re-authentication.
5.  **Refresh Token Persistence**: The generated refresh token is securely stored in the internal database, allowing server-side validation and revocation capabilities.
6.  **Security Context Population**: The authenticated user's details are stored in the application's security context (e.g., Spring SecurityContextHolder), making the user's identity and roles accessible throughout the current request.
7.  **Cookie Management**: Various secure cookies are set in the client's browser:
    *   `accessToken`, `refreshToken`, `sessionId`: Marked as `HttpOnly` to prevent client-side script access, `Secure` for HTTPS-only transmission, and `SameSite=Lax` for CSRF protection.
    *   `XSRF-TOKEN`: This cookie is intentionally *not* `HttpOnly` so that client-side JavaScript can read it and include it in subsequent requests for CSRF protection.

### 5. Dependencies

*   **Request/Response Entities**:
    *   `AuthCallbackRequest`: DTO for incoming callback parameters.
    *   `TokenResponse`: DTO for the outgoing successful response payload.
    *   `UserEntity`: Represents a user in the internal database.
    *   `RefreshTokenEntity`: Represents a stored refresh token in the internal database.
*   **Services/Libraries**:
    *   `AuthService`: Centralized business logic for authentication flow.
    *   `ExternalAuthService`: Handles communication with external Identity Providers.
    *   `UserService`: Manages user creation and retrieval.
    *   `TokenService`: Responsible for generating internal JWTs.
    *   `RefreshTokenService`: Manages persistence and validation of refresh tokens.
    *   `CookieService`: Utility for setting secure HTTP cookies.
    *   `JwtUtil`: Utility library for JWT creation, signing, and validation (e.g., using JJWT).
    *   `HttpClient`: For making external HTTP calls (e.g., Apache HttpClient, Spring WebClient).
*   **Database Entities/Tables**:
    *   `User` table (or similar, corresponding to `UserEntity`).
    *   `RefreshToken` table (or similar, corresponding to `RefreshTokenEntity`).
*   **Frameworks/Utilities**:
    *   Spring Framework (Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA).
    *   Lombok (for boilerplate reduction in DTOs/Entities).
    *   SLF4J (or similar logging framework) for logging operations and errors.

### 6. Security Features

*   **JWT Security**:
    *   **Signing**: Both access and refresh tokens are digitally signed to ensure their integrity and authenticity, preventing tampering.
    *   **Expiration**: Access tokens are short-lived, minimizing the window of opportunity for misuse if compromised. Refresh tokens are longer-lived but still have an expiration.
    *   **Refresh Token Revocation**: Refresh tokens are stored in the database, allowing them to be explicitly revoked (e.g., on logout, compromise detection) before their natural expiry.
*   **Cookie Security**:
    *   **`HttpOnly`**: All sensitive tokens (`accessToken`, `refreshToken`, `sessionId`) are delivered via `HttpOnly` cookies, preventing client-side JavaScript from accessing them. This mitigates XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks that attempt to steal tokens.
    *   **`Secure`**: All cookies are marked `Secure`, ensuring they are only transmitted over HTTPS connections, protecting against eavesdropping.
    *   **`SameSite=Lax`**: Set on all cookies to mitigate CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks by restricting when cookies are sent with cross-site requests.
*   **CSRF Protection (`XSRF-TOKEN` cookie)**:
    *   A separate `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie (not `HttpOnly`) is provided to the client. The client-side application is expected to read this token and include it as a custom HTTP header (e.g., `X-XSRF-TOKEN`) in all state-changing requests. The server then validates this header against the cookie value to prevent CSRF.
*   **Input Validation**: The incoming `AuthCallbackRequest` is validated to ensure essential parameters (`authCode`, `redirectUri`) are present and conform to expected formats, preventing malicious or malformed inputs.
*   **Session Management**: Utilizes `HttpSession` (often managed by Spring Security) for server-side session tracking, which complements token-based authentication for stateful operations or additional security layers.
*   **CORS Handling**: The endpoint is implicitly designed to handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers, allowing frontend applications hosted on different origins to interact securely with this endpoint.

### 7. Error Handling

*   **Centralized Exception Handling**: Errors are likely handled through a global exception handler (e.g., Spring's `@ControllerAdvice`) to provide consistent error responses.
*   **Types of Errors Handled**:
    *   **Invalid Authentication Code**: If the `authCode` is invalid or expired when exchanged with the external IdP.
    *   **Invalid Redirect URI**: If the `redirectUri` provided does not match the one registered with the external IdP or the one used to initiate the flow.
    *   **External IdP Communication Errors**: Network issues or errors from the external IdP.
    *   **User Not Found/Creation Issues**: Problems during user lookup or creation in the internal database.
    *   **Token Generation Failures**: Issues during the creation or signing of internal JWTs.
    *   **Database Errors**: Failures when persisting refresh tokens or user data.
*   **Error Logging**: All significant errors are logged internally (e.g., using SLF4J) with sufficient detail (stack traces, relevant request context) for debugging and monitoring.
*   **Error Response Structure**: For client-facing errors, a standardized JSON error response is returned, typically including:
    ```json
    {
      "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:30:00.000Z",
      "status": 400, // HTTP Status Code
      "error": "Bad Request", // HTTP Status Name
      "message": "Invalid authentication code provided.", // User-friendly message
      "path": "/auth/callback"
    }
    ```
*   **No Sensitive Information Leakage**: Error messages are carefully crafted to avoid exposing sensitive internal system details or stack traces to the client.

### 8. Performance Considerations

*   **Efficient External Calls**: The `ExternalAuthService` call to the IdP should be optimized for low latency, potentially utilizing connection pooling for `HttpClient`.
*   **Database Operation Efficiency**: User lookup (`UserRepository.findByExternalId`) and refresh token saving (`RefreshTokenRepository.save`) are critical path operations. Indexes on relevant database columns (e.g., `externalId` on `User` table, `userId` on `RefreshToken` table) are crucial for fast lookups.
*   **JWT Generation**: JWT signing and generation (`JwtUtil`) are computationally efficient operations, but using optimized libraries and avoiding excessive claims can keep overhead minimal.
*   **Cookie Overhead**: The number and size of cookies are kept minimal to reduce request/response payload size. Using compact JWTs is important.
*   **Metrics Collection**: The system is likely configured to collect metrics (e.g., request latency, success rates, error rates) for this endpoint, enabling monitoring and performance tuning.
*   **Minimal Response Payload**: The `TokenResponse` payload is kept concise, primarily for confirmation, as sensitive tokens are delivered via HttpOnly cookies.

### 9. Usage Pattern

*   **Context**: This endpoint is typically called by a frontend application (web or mobile) as part of an OAuth2/OIDC authorization code flow. It is the final step after a user successfully authenticates with an external Identity Provider.
*   **Prerequisites**:
    1.  The user must have initiated an authentication flow with an external Identity Provider (e.g., Google, Okta, Auth0) and successfully completed their authentication on the IdP's side.
    2.  The external IdP must have redirected the user back to the client application with an `authorization code` (and potentially a `state` parameter) as a URL parameter.
    3.  The client application then extracts this `authorization code` and `redirectUri` and sends them in a `POST` request to this `/auth/callback` endpoint.
*   **Typical Flow**:
    1.  User clicks "Login with Google" on the client app.
    2.  Client redirects user to Google's authorization page.
    3.  User authenticates with Google.
    4.  Google redirects user back to `client-app-redirect-uri?code=xxx&state=yyy`.
    5.  Client app extracts `code` and `state`.
    6.  Client app makes a `POST` request to `/auth/callback` with `{"authCode": "xxx", "redirectUri": "client-app-redirect-uri", "state": "yyy"}`.
    7.  This endpoint processes the request, sets secure cookies, and returns a success response.
    8.  Client app can now make authenticated API calls using the issued tokens/session.

### 10. Additional Notes

*   **Extensibility**: The design, particularly the `ExternalAuthService`, suggests potential for easy extension to support multiple external Identity Providers (e.g., adding Facebook, GitHub, etc.) by implementing different `exchangeCodeForTokens` logic based on a provider identifier.
*   **Session State**: While JWTs are stateless in nature, the inclusion of `sessionId` cookies indicates that a server-side session might also be maintained for additional security layers (e.g., Spring Session, session attributes for specific user states).
*   **`state` Parameter**: The `state` parameter in `AuthCallbackRequest` should be used by the client to verify the integrity of the callback request and prevent CSRF attacks. The server-side validation of this `state` parameter against a stored value is a best practice, though not explicitly shown in the provided hierarchy.
*   **Token Refresh Flow**: This endpoint issues a refresh token, which implies a separate endpoint (e.g., `/auth/refresh`) would exist to handle the exchange of an expired access token for a new one using the refresh token, without requiring a full re-authentication with the external IdP.
