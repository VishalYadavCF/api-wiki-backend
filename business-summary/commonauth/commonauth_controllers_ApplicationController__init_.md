### API Endpoint Documentation: User Authentication & Token Issuance

This document describes the `POST /api/v1/auth/login` endpoint, which facilitates user authentication and issues security tokens for subsequent API interactions.

---

### 1. Endpoint Overview

*   **Endpoint Path**: `/api/v1/auth/login`
*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Consumes**: `application/json` (Expected request body format)
*   **Produces**: `application/json` (Response body format)
*   **Brief Description**: This endpoint allows users to log in to the system by providing their credentials (username and password). Upon successful authentication, it generates and issues both a short-lived access token and a long-lived refresh token. The refresh token is typically set as a secure HTTP-only cookie, while the access token is returned in the response body for immediate use.
*   **Controller Method Name**: `AuthnController.authenticateUser`
*   **Primary Function**: To securely verify user credentials, generate authentication and authorization tokens (JWTs), manage session state via cookies, and provide a success response containing the necessary tokens for continued API access.

---

### 4. Key Operations

The primary operations performed by this endpoint are:

*   **Request Validation**: Ensures the incoming `LoginRequest` payload is well-formed and contains the necessary `username` and `password` fields.
*   **User Authentication**: Verifies the provided credentials against stored user data, typically involving database lookup and secure password hashing comparison.
*   **Token Generation**: Creates two types of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs):
    *   **Access Token**: A short-lived token used by the client for subsequent authorized API calls.
    *   **Refresh Token**: A long-lived token used to obtain new access tokens when the current one expires, without requiring the user to re-authenticate.
*   **Refresh Token Management**: Persists the generated refresh token in a secure data store, allowing for its later validation or revocation.
*   **Cookie Management**: Sets the refresh token as a secure, HTTP-only cookie in the client's browser, preventing client-side JavaScript access and enhancing security.
*   **Response Construction**: Formats the success response to include the access token and relevant user profile information, adhering to the `application/json` standard.

---

### 5. Dependencies

This endpoint relies on several components and data structures to function correctly:

*   **Request/Response Entities (DTOs)**:
    *   `LoginRequest`: Data Transfer Object for incoming authentication credentials.
    *   `AuthResponse`: DTO for the outgoing successful authentication response, containing tokens and user data.
    *   `UserProfile`: DTO containing publicly available user information.
    *   `User` (Entity/Model): Represents the user data as stored in the database.
    *   `RefreshTokenEntity`: Represents the refresh token data as stored in the database.
*   **Services/Libraries**:
    *   `UserService`: Handles user-related business logic (e.g., validation, retrieval).
    *   `TokenService`: Manages the generation of access and refresh tokens.
    *   `RefreshTokenService`: Handles the storage and management of refresh tokens.
    *   `CookieService`: Utility for securely setting HTTP cookies.
    *   `AuthResponseBuilder`: Helper for structuring the response payload.
    *   `JwtUtil` (or a dedicated JWT library like `jjwt` for Java, `jsonwebtoken` for Node.js): For JWT creation, signing, and verification.
    *   `PasswordEncoder` (e.g., from Spring Security or similar): For secure password hashing.
*   **Database Entities/Tables**:
    *   `users` table: Stores user credentials and profile information.
    *   `refresh_tokens` table: Stores details about issued refresh tokens (token string, user ID, expiry, etc.).
*   **Frameworks/Utilities**:
    *   Web Framework (e.g., Spring Boot, Express.js): For handling HTTP requests, routing, and dependency injection.
    *   Security Framework (e.g., Spring Security): For authentication abstractions and password encoding.
    *   Logging Utilities (e.g., SLF4J/Logback, Winston): For application logging and monitoring.

### 6. Security Features

The endpoint incorporates several security measures to protect user data and maintain session integrity:

*   **Password Hashing**: User passwords are never stored in plain text. `PasswordEncoder` is used to hash passwords before storage and to securely compare incoming passwords during authentication, preventing credential compromise even if the database is breached.
*   **JWT Security**:
    *   **Signed Tokens**: JWTs are cryptographically signed (`JwtUtil`) using a secret key, ensuring their integrity and authenticity (i.e., they haven't been tampered with).
    *   **Expiration**: Access tokens are designed to be short-lived (`expiresIn` typically minutes or hours), limiting the window of opportunity for compromise if intercepted. Refresh tokens are longer-lived but still have an expiration.
    *   **Refresh Token Mechanism**: By using a separate refresh token, the system minimizes the exposure of the more frequently used access token. If an access token is compromised, a new one can be issued using the refresh token, and the old access token will quickly expire.
*   **Cookie Security (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`)**: The refresh token cookie is configured with:
    *   `HttpOnly`: Prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie, mitigating XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.
    *   `Secure`: Ensures the cookie is only sent over HTTPS connections, protecting against eavesdropping.
    *   `SameSite=Lax` (or `Strict`): Helps protect against CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks by controlling when the browser sends cookies with cross-site requests.
*   **Input Validation**: Strict validation of the `LoginRequest` payload prevents common injection attacks and ensures only expected data formats are processed.
*   **Error Masking**: Error responses avoid revealing sensitive information (e.g., specific reasons for authentication failure beyond "Invalid Credentials").

---

### 7. Error Handling

Error handling is designed to be robust, informative for developers, and secure for clients:

*   **Types of Errors Handled**:
    *   **Invalid Input (`400 Bad Request`)**: Occurs if the `LoginRequest` payload is malformed, missing required fields (e.g., username or password), or fails initial validation rules.
    *   **Authentication Failure (`401 Unauthorized`)**: Returned for incorrect username/password combinations, non-existent users, or accounts that are disabled/locked. The message typically remains generic (e.g., "Invalid credentials") to prevent user enumeration attacks.
    *   **Internal Server Error (`500 Internal Server Error`)**: Catches unexpected issues within the backend, such as database connection problems, token generation failures, or unhandled exceptions.
*   **Error Logging**: All errors, especially `500` errors and authentication failures, are logged with sufficient detail (e.g., stack traces, relevant context) using the application's logging framework. This aids in debugging and monitoring without exposing sensitive details to the client.
*   **Error Propagation**: Exceptions are caught at appropriate layers (`UserService`, `TokenService`) and either rethrown as custom, business-specific exceptions or wrapped into a common exception type that the `AuthnController` can translate into a standardized HTTP response.
*   **Error Response Structure**: For client-facing errors, a consistent JSON format is usually returned:
    ```json
    {
      "timestamp": "ISO_8601_DATETIME",
      "status": 401,
      "error": "Unauthorized",
      "message": "Invalid credentials provided.",
      "path": "/api/v1/auth/login"
    }
    ```

### 8. Performance Considerations

The endpoint's design incorporates several aspects to ensure efficient operation:

*   **Efficient Database Operations**:
    *   `UserRepository.findByUsername`: Assumes efficient indexing on the `username` column in the `users` table for fast lookups.
    *   `RefreshTokenRepository.save`: Assumes optimized writes for storing refresh tokens.
*   **Optimized Token Generation**: The `JwtUtil` methods are designed for quick cryptographic operations to generate JWTs, minimizing overhead.
*   **Minimal Cookie Size**: The refresh token is the only significant data stored in a cookie. Keeping cookie payload minimal reduces request/response header size.
*   **Metrics Collection**: The endpoint should be integrated with a monitoring system to collect performance metrics such as response time, throughput, and error rates, enabling proactive identification of bottlenecks.
*   **Stateless Access Tokens**: Access tokens are stateless (self-contained), meaning the server doesn't need to perform a database lookup for every API call, reducing load on the database for authorized requests.

---

### 9. Usage Pattern

This endpoint is a fundamental part of the user authentication flow and is typically called in the following context:

*   **Initial User Login**: When a user submits their username and password via a login form on a web application or directly via an API client.
*   **Session Establishment**: Upon successful authentication, it establishes a user session by providing the necessary tokens (access token for immediate use and refresh token for session longevity).
*   **Prerequisites**:
    *   The user must have an existing, registered account in the system.
    *   The provided `username` and `password` must be correct and match the stored credentials for an active account.
    *   The client application (e.g., web browser, mobile app) must be capable of receiving and managing both the access token (typically stored in memory or local storage) and the HttpOnly refresh token cookie.

After a successful call to this endpoint, the client typically uses the `accessToken` in the `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` header for all subsequent protected API calls until it expires. The `refreshToken` (from the HttpOnly cookie) is then used to request a new `accessToken` via a separate `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh-token` endpoint.

---

### 10. Additional Notes

*   **Assumptions**: This documentation assumes a standard JWT-based authentication system with a distinct refresh token flow managed via HttpOnly cookies. The specific names of services and utility classes are illustrative and may vary based on the programming language and framework used (e.g., Spring for Java, Express for Node.js).
*   **Rate Limiting**: While not explicitly detailed in the hierarchy, it is highly recommended to implement rate limiting on this endpoint to prevent brute-force login attempts and denial-of-service attacks.
*   **MFA/2FA Integration**: For enhanced security, this endpoint could be extended to support Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) flows, where a successful password validation triggers a second step (e.g., OTP verification).
*   **Password Change on First Login**: For new users, a common practice is to enforce a password change on the first successful login after initial account creation. This would typically be handled as a flag on the `UserProfile` or by a separate policy check in the `UserService`.
*   **Scalability**: The design emphasizes stateless access tokens, which is crucial for horizontally scaling backend services as no session data needs to be shared across instances for authorized requests.
