**API Endpoint Documentation: User Authentication & Token Generation**

This document details an API endpoint designed for user authentication, session establishment, and secure token issuance.

---

### 1. Endpoint Overview

*   **Endpoint Path**: `/api/v1/auth/login`
*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Consumes Media Type**: `application/json` (for request body)
*   **Produces Media Type**: `application/json` (for response body)
*   **Purpose**: This endpoint allows users to authenticate themselves with their credentials, generating secure JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for both access and refresh purposes. These tokens are then delivered via secure, HttpOnly cookies, establishing a secure session for subsequent API interactions.
*   **Controller Method Name**: `AuthEndpoint.login(LoginRequest loginRequest)`
*   **Primary Function**: Handles user login, validates credentials, generates short-lived access tokens and longer-lived refresh tokens, and sets these tokens as secure HTTP-only cookies in the client's browser for session management.

### 2. Request and Response

*   **Request Type**: The endpoint expects a JSON payload containing user credentials.
    *   **Payload Structure (Example)**:
        ```json
        {
          "username": "user.example@example.com",
          "password": "securePassword123!"
        }
        ```
    *   **Input Parameters**:
        *   `username`: (String, required) The unique identifier for the user (e.g., email address, username).
        *   `password`: (String, required) The user's plain-text password.
*   **Response Type**: Upon successful authentication, the endpoint returns a success status with minimal body content (a confirmation message or basic user info) and sets critical authentication cookies in the response headers.
    *   **Success Response (Example)**:
        *   **HTTP Status Code**: `200 OK`
        *   **Headers**:
            *   `Set-Cookie`: `accessToken=<JWT>; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Max-Age=<expiry_seconds>`
            *   `Set-Cookie`: `refreshToken=<JWT>; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Max-Age=<expiry_seconds>`
            *   `Content-Type`: `application/json`
        *   **Payload Structure (Example)**:
            ```json
            {
              "message": "Login successful",
              "userId": "user123",
              "username": "user.example@example.com"
            }
            ```
    *   **Error Response (Example)**: See "Error Handling" section for detailed error structures.

### 3. Call Hierarchy

The following represents the detailed flow of execution when the `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint is invoked:

*   **`AuthEndpoint.login(LoginRequest loginRequest)`**:
    *   This is the primary controller method that receives the incoming login request.
    *   It initiates the authentication process by invoking the `AuthService`.
    *   **`AuthService.authenticateUser(username, password)`**:
        *   This service handles the core authentication logic.
        *   **`UserDetailsServiceImpl.loadUserByUsername(username)`**:
            *   Called to retrieve user details from the persistent storage.
            *   **`UserRepository.findByUsername(username)`**:
                *   Performs the actual database query to fetch the user record based on the provided username.
                *   Returns `UserDetails` object (or similar representation) containing the stored hashed password and user roles/authorities.
        *   **`BCryptPasswordEncoder.matches(rawPassword, encodedPassword)`**:
            *   Compares the provided `rawPassword` (from `LoginRequest`) with the `encodedPassword` fetched from the database using a cryptographically secure hashing algorithm (BCrypt). This confirms the password's correctness without storing or exposing the plain-text password.
        *   **`AuthenticationManager.authenticate(UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken)`**:
            *   Integrates with the underlying Spring Security framework to perform the final authentication attempt. If credentials match, it returns an `Authentication` object representing the authenticated principal.
    *   **`JwtTokenProvider.generateToken(Authentication authentication)`**:
        *   Upon successful authentication, this method generates a short-lived Access Token (JWT).
        *   **`Jwts.builder().setClaims().signWith().compact()`**:
            *   Uses a JWT library (e.g., JJWT) to construct the JWT. It embeds user identity (claims), sets an expiration time, and signs the token with a secret key to ensure its integrity and authenticity.
    *   **`JwtTokenProvider.generateRefreshToken(Authentication authentication)`**:
        *   This method generates a longer-lived Refresh Token (JWT).
        *   **`Jwts.builder().setClaims().signWith().compact()`**:
            *   Similar to the access token, it constructs a JWT for refresh purposes, but with a significantly longer expiration time. This token is used to obtain new access tokens without requiring re-authentication.
    *   **`CookieService.createAccessTokenCookie(accessToken)`**:
        *   Responsible for constructing the `ResponseCookie` object for the access token.
        *   **`ResponseCookie.from().httpOnly().secure().sameSite().build()`**:
            *   Sets important security attributes for the cookie: `HttpOnly` (prevents client-side script access), `Secure` (sends only over HTTPS), `SameSite` (mitigates CSRF), and an appropriate `Max-Age`.
    *   **`CookieService.createRefreshTokenCookie(refreshToken)`**:
        *   Responsible for constructing the `ResponseCookie` object for the refresh token, with similar security attributes.
        *   **`ResponseCookie.from().httpOnly().secure().sameSite().build()`**:
            *   Applies the same secure cookie attributes as the access token.
    *   **`SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authentication)`**:
        *   Updates the application's security context with the newly authenticated user's `Authentication` object. This allows subsequent security checks within the current request to recognize the user.
    *   **`ResponseEntity.ok().header(SET_COOKIE).body(LoginResponse)`**:
        *   Constructs the final HTTP response, including setting the `Set-Cookie` headers for both access and refresh tokens and providing a success body.

### 4. Key Operations

*   **Request Validation**: Ensures that the incoming `LoginRequest` contains valid and expected `username` and `password` fields.
*   **User Authentication**: The core process of verifying the user's identity by comparing provided credentials against stored hashed passwords. This involves retrieving user data from the database and securely validating the password.
*   **Access Token Generation**: Creates a short-lived JWT that represents the user's authorization to access protected resources. This token is designed to expire relatively quickly to limit the window of compromise if intercepted.
*   **Refresh Token Generation**: Creates a long-lived JWT used to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to re-enter credentials. This improves user experience while maintaining a good security posture.
*   **Secure Cookie Management**: Encapsulates the generated JWTs into HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite cookies, crucial for secure session management by preventing client-side script access, ensuring transmission over encrypted channels, and mitigating Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   **Security Context Update**: Integrates the authenticated user's information into the application's security context, making it available for authorization checks throughout the current request.

### 5. Dependencies

*   **Request/Response Entities (DTOs)**:
    *   `LoginRequest`: Data Transfer Object (DTO) for incoming user credentials.
    *   `LoginResponse`: DTO for the successful response body (e.g., confirmation message, basic user info).
    *   `User` (or `UserDetails`): Represents the user entity/data model retrieved from the database, containing hashed password, roles, etc.
*   **Services/Components**:
    *   `AuthService`: Orchestrates the authentication flow.
    *   `JwtTokenProvider`: Manages the generation and validation of JWTs.
    *   `CookieService`: Handles the creation of secure HTTP cookies.
    *   `UserDetailsServiceImpl`: Custom implementation for loading user-specific data from a data source (part of Spring Security).
    *   `UserRepository`: Data access layer component for interacting with the user database table.
*   **Libraries/Frameworks**:
    *   **Spring Boot/Spring Web**: Provides the core framework for building RESTful APIs.
    *   **Spring Security**: Handles authentication, authorization, and integrates with `UserDetailsServiceImpl`, `AuthenticationManager`, and `SecurityContextHolder`.
    *   **JJWT (Java JWT)**: Library for generating, signing, and parsing JWTs.
    *   **BCryptPasswordEncoder**: For secure password hashing and comparison (part of Spring Security Crypto).
    *   **SLF4j/Logback**: For logging purposes throughout the application.
*   **Database**:
    *   `users` table (or similar): Stores user credentials (hashed passwords), roles, and other user-related information.

### 6. Security Features

*   **Password Hashing**: User passwords are never stored or transmitted in plain text. `BCryptPasswordEncoder` is used to hash passwords, ensuring that even if the database is compromised, actual passwords remain protected.
*   **JWT Security**:
    *   **Signing**: JWTs are digitally signed using a strong secret key, preventing tampering and ensuring their authenticity.
    *   **Expiration**: Both access and refresh tokens have defined expiration times, limiting the window of opportunity for token misuse if intercepted. Access tokens are short-lived, while refresh tokens are longer-lived but used primarily for token renewal.
*   **Cookie Security**:
    *   **`HttpOnly`**: The `accessToken` and `refreshToken` cookies are marked `HttpOnly`, preventing client-side JavaScript from accessing them. This significantly reduces the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks stealing session tokens.
    *   **`Secure`**: Cookies are marked `Secure`, ensuring they are only sent over encrypted HTTPS connections, protecting them from eavesdropping.
    *   **`SameSite=Lax`**: The `SameSite` attribute helps mitigate Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by controlling when cookies are sent with cross-origin requests. `Lax` is a balanced setting, allowing essential navigation while providing protection.
*   **Input Validation**: The endpoint relies on framework-level or explicit validation to ensure that incoming request payloads are well-formed and contain expected data, preventing common injection attacks or malformed requests.
*   **Authentication Mechanism**: Leverages Spring Security's robust authentication framework, which supports various authentication providers and best practices.

### 7. Error Handling

*   **Invalid Credentials**: If the provided `username` or `password` does not match, an `AuthenticationException` (e.g., `BadCredentialsException`) is caught.
    *   **Response**: Returns an `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` status code with a generic error message (e.g., `"Invalid username or password"`) to prevent enumeration attacks.
    *   **Logging**: Errors are logged internally (e.g., `WARN` or `ERROR` level) with details about the failed authentication attempt, but without exposing sensitive user information.
*   **User Not Found**: If the `username` does not exist in the system, `UserDetailsServiceImpl` will typically throw a `UsernameNotFoundException`.
    *   **Response**: Similar to invalid credentials, an `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` status code with a generic message is returned for security reasons.
    *   **Logging**: Internal logs capture the attempt to access a non-existent user.
*   **Internal Server Errors**: Any unexpected exceptions during token generation, database operations, or other internal processes are caught.
    *   **Response**: Returns an `HTTP 500 Internal Server Error` with a generic message (e.g., `"An unexpected error occurred"`) to the client.
    *   **Logging**: Detailed exception stack traces and relevant context are logged at `ERROR` level for debugging and monitoring.
*   **Error Response Structure (Common)**:
    ```json
    {
      "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:30:00.000Z",
      "status": 401,
      "error": "Unauthorized",
      "message": "Invalid username or password",
      "path": "/api/v1/auth/login"
    }
    ```

### 8. Performance Considerations

*   **Efficient Password Hashing**: While BCrypt is computationally intensive by design (to deter brute-force attacks), its performance is optimized for typical server environments, and its cost is acceptable for login operations.
*   **Database Query Optimization**: The `UserRepository.findByUsername` operation should be backed by an efficient index on the `username` column in the `users` table to ensure fast retrieval.
*   **JWT Generation Efficiency**: JWT generation is a lightweight cryptographic operation and typically very fast, adding minimal overhead.
*   **Minimal Response Payload**: The success response body is kept concise, reducing network traffic.
*   **Cookie Size**: JWTs, by nature, can be larger than simple session IDs. However, they are designed to be efficient enough for HTTP headers, and typical sizes are manageable for most network conditions.
*   **Metrics Collection**: The endpoint is likely instrumented with metrics (e.g., using Micrometer/Prometheus) to monitor response times, error rates, and throughput, allowing for performance bottlenecks to be identified and addressed.

### 9. Usage Pattern

This endpoint serves as the entry point for authenticated user sessions.

*   **Typical Use Case**: It is invoked by client applications (e.g., web browsers, mobile apps) immediately after a user enters their login credentials.
*   **Sequence of Events**:
    1.  User enters username and password into a client application's login form.
    2.  The client application sends a `POST` request to `/api/v1/auth/login` with the credentials in the JSON body.
    3.  The server processes the request, authenticates the user, and generates tokens.
    4.  The server responds with `200 OK` and sets the `accessToken` and `refreshToken` cookies in the client's browser.
    5.  For subsequent API calls requiring authentication, the client browser automatically sends these cookies (if they are within the appropriate domain/path scope), allowing the backend to validate the user's session without requiring explicit token management from the client-side JavaScript.
*   **Prerequisites**:
    *   The user must have a pre-registered account in the system.
    *   The client application must be configured to correctly send JSON payloads and handle `Set-Cookie` headers.

### 10. Additional Notes

*   **Refresh Token Flow**: While this endpoint only covers initial login, the `refreshToken` issued here is crucial for future operations. Client applications typically use the `refreshToken` to obtain new `accessToken`s once the current `accessToken` expires, usually via a dedicated `/api/v1/auth/refresh-token` or similar endpoint. This prevents users from having to re-login frequently.
*   **Token Revocation**: This endpoint does not directly implement token revocation. Token revocation typically occurs during logout (where cookies are cleared) or through an explicit revocation mechanism (e.g., blacklisting tokens or managing sessions in a database) for compromised tokens.
*   **CORS Configuration**: This endpoint should be part of a broader API that has appropriate Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configurations, especially if the client application is hosted on a different domain. This is essential for allowing browsers to make requests to this endpoint from other origins.
*   **Rate Limiting**: For production environments, it is highly recommended to implement rate limiting on this endpoint to prevent brute-force login attempts.
*   **Configuration**: The JWT secret keys, token expiration times, and cookie attributes (like `SameSite` policy) are typically configurable through application properties (e.g., `application.yml` or environment variables) for different environments (development, production).
