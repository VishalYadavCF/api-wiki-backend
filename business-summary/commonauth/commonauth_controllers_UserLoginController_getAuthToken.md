### API Endpoint Documentation: `/api/v1/auth/login`

#### 1. Endpoint Overview

*   **Endpoint Path**: `/api/v1/auth/login`
*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Consumes**: `application/json` (expects request body in JSON format)
*   **Produces**: `application/json` (returns response body in JSON format)
*   **Purpose**: This endpoint facilitates user authentication by validating provided credentials. Upon successful validation, it generates secure JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) – an access token and a refresh token – and sets them as HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite cookies in the client's browser. This process establishes a secure, stateless session for the user.
*   **Controller Method Name**: `AuthLoginController.loginEndpoint`
*   **Primary Function**: To authenticate a user, issue security tokens, and manage the secure delivery of these tokens via HTTP cookies.

#### 2. Request and Response

**Request Type**:
The request body is a JSON object containing the user's login credentials.

*   **Parameters**:
    *   `username` (string, required): The user's unique identifier (e.g., email or username).
    *   `password` (string, required): The user's plain-text password.
*   **Example Request Payload**:
    ```json
    {
        "username": "user.name@example.com",
        "password": "mySecurePassword123!"
    }
    ```

**Response Type**:

*   **Success Response (HTTP Status: `200 OK`)**:
    *   **Payload Structure**: A JSON object indicating successful login. The payload is typically minimal as tokens are delivered via cookies.
    *   **Example Success Payload**:
        ```json
        {
            "message": "Login successful",
            "userId": "some-unique-user-id" // Optional: may include a user identifier
        }
        ```
    *   **Headers**:
        *   `Set-Cookie`: Two `Set-Cookie` headers will be present, one for the access token (`authToken`) and one for the refresh token (`refreshToken`). These cookies are configured with robust security flags (see "Security Features" section).
            *   `authToken`: Contains the short-lived access JWT.
            *   `refreshToken`: Contains the long-lived refresh JWT.

*   **Error Response (HTTP Status: `400 Bad Request` or `401 Unauthorized`)**:
    *   **`400 Bad Request` (Client-side validation error)**:
        *   Occurs if required input parameters (`username`, `password`) are missing or malformed.
        *   **Payload Structure**:
            ```json
            {
                "error": "Validation Failed",
                "details": "Username or password is required."
            }
            ```
    *   **`401 Unauthorized` (Authentication failure)**:
        *   Occurs if the provided `username` and `password` do not match any registered user.
        *   **Payload Structure**:
            ```json
            {
                "error": "Authentication Failed",
                "details": "Invalid username or password."
            }
            ```
    *   **`500 Internal Server Error` (Server-side issue)**:
        *   Occurs due to unexpected server-side errors (e.g., database connection issues, misconfiguration).
        *   **Payload Structure (typically generic)**:
            ```json
            {
                "error": "Internal Server Error",
                "details": "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later."
            }
            ```

#### 3. Call Hierarchy

The `AuthLoginController.loginEndpoint` orchestrates a sequence of operations to handle the login request securely and efficiently.

1.  **`AuthLoginController.loginEndpoint`** (Entry Point: `POST /api/v1/auth/login`)
    *   **Input**: `LoginRequestDTO` (containing `username` and `password`).
    *   **Purpose**: Initiates the authentication flow.
    *   **Key Operations**:
        *   Initial validation of the request payload (e.g., checks if `username` and `password` are present).
        *   Invokes the core authentication service.
        *   Handles successful authentication by generating tokens and setting cookies.
        *   Catches and processes authentication failures.

    *   **Flow**:
        *   **a. Calls `AuthenticationService.authenticateUser(username, password)`**
            *   **Purpose**: This service is responsible for verifying the provided user credentials against the system's stored records.
            *   **Sub-operations**:
                *   **i. Calls `UserDetailsService.loadUserByUsername(username)`**
                    *   **Purpose**: Retrieves the user's details (including their hashed password and roles) from the persistence layer.
                    *   **Sub-operation**:
                        *   **Calls `UserRepository.findByUsername(username)`**
                            *   **Purpose**: Directly queries the database to fetch the user record.
                            *   **Database Interaction**: Performs a `SELECT` operation on the `users` table, filtering by the `username`.
                *   **ii. Calls `PasswordEncoder.matches(rawPassword, encodedPassword)`**
                    *   **Purpose**: Securely compares the plain-text password provided by the user with the stored hashed password. This operation prevents direct comparison of passwords, enhancing security.

        *   **b. Conditional Branch: IF `AuthenticationService.authenticateUser` is successful**:
            *   **i. Calls `JwtTokenService.generateAccessToken(userDetails)`**
                *   **Purpose**: Creates a short-lived JSON Web Token (JWT) that will be used for subsequent authorized API requests.
                *   **Underlying Operation**: Utilizes a `JWT_LIB` (e.g., JJWT) to sign the token with relevant claims (e.g., user ID, roles, expiration time) using a secret key.
            *   **ii. Calls `JwtTokenService.generateRefreshToken(userDetails)`**
                *   **Purpose**: Creates a long-lived JWT that can be used to obtain new access tokens once the current access token expires, avoiding repeated full authentication.
                *   **Underlying Operation**: Similar to access token generation, uses `JWT_LIB` to sign the token with distinct claims and a longer expiration.
            *   **iii. Calls `CookieService.createAuthCookie(accessToken, refreshToken)`**
                *   **Purpose**: Prepares and adds the generated JWTs as secure HTTP-only cookies to the HTTP response.
                *   **Operations**:
                    *   Sets `authToken` cookie with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax`, and a `Path` of `/api`. Its expiration matches the access token.
                    *   Sets `refreshToken` cookie with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax`, and a specific `Path` of `/api/auth/refresh`. Its expiration matches the refresh token.
            *   **iv. Constructs and returns `ResponseEntity<LoginResponseDTO>`** with `200 OK` status and a success message.

        *   **c. Conditional Branch: IF `AuthenticationService.authenticateUser` fails**:
            *   An **`ExceptionHandler`** (often a global mechanism like Spring's `@ControllerAdvice`) catches the authentication failure exception (e.g., `AuthenticationException`).
            *   **Logging**: The exception is logged internally for debugging and monitoring purposes.
            *   **Response**: Constructs and returns an `ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse>` with `401 Unauthorized` status and a generic error message to the client.

#### 4. Key Operations

The endpoint performs several critical operations:

*   **Request Validation**: Ensures the incoming JSON payload contains all necessary fields (`username`, `password`) and adheres to basic format requirements before processing.
*   **User Credential Verification**: Securely validates the user's provided password against the hashed password stored in the database using a strong password encoder.
*   **JWT Generation**: Creates two types of JSON Web Tokens: a short-lived access token for immediate API authorization and a long-lived refresh token for token renewal. Both are cryptographically signed.
*   **Secure Cookie Management**: Encapsulates the generated JWTs within highly secure HTTP-only cookies, configuring crucial attributes like `Secure`, `SameSite`, and `Path` to enhance client-side security.
*   **Response Construction**: Formats the API response, whether it's a success message with cookies or a detailed error message, ensuring clear communication with the client.

#### 5. Dependencies

This endpoint relies on several components, services, and libraries:

*   **Request/Response Entities (Data Models)**:
    *   `LoginRequestDTO`: Represents the incoming JSON payload for login.
    *   `LoginResponseDTO`: Represents the successful outgoing JSON payload.
    *   `ErrorResponse`: Standardized structure for error messages.
    *   `UserDetails` (internal): A data model typically used within authentication frameworks (like Spring Security) to hold authenticated user information.
*   **Services/Libraries**:
    *   `AuthenticationService`: Orchestrates the core authentication logic.
    *   `UserDetailsService`: An interface/service responsible for loading user-specific data during authentication.
    *   `JwtTokenService`: Dedicated service for generating and managing JWTs.
    *   `CookieService`: Utility for creating and configuring HTTP cookies.
    *   `UserRepository`: Data access layer for retrieving user records from the database.
    *   `PasswordEncoder`: (e.g., `BCryptPasswordEncoder`) For secure password hashing and comparison.
    *   `JWT Library`: (e.g., JJWT, Nimbus JOSE + JWT) A third-party library for JWT creation, signing, and parsing.
*   **Database Entities/Tables**:
    *   `users` table: Stores user information, including `username`, `password_hash`, and `roles`.
*   **Frameworks/Utilities**:
    *   Spring Boot, Spring Web: For building the RESTful API and handling HTTP requests/responses.
    *   Spring Security: Provides the foundational framework for authentication, user details management, and password encoding.
    *   Spring Data JPA (if applicable): For simplifying database interactions via `UserRepository`.
    *   Logging utilities (e.g., SLF4J, Logback): For recording operational information and errors.

#### 6. Security Features

The endpoint is designed with robust security in mind:

*   **Password Hashing**: Passwords are never stored or compared in plain text. `PasswordEncoder` (e.g., BCrypt) hashes passwords before storage and securely compares incoming passwords against the hash, preventing credential theft even if the database is compromised.
*   **JWT Signing**: Both access and refresh tokens are digitally signed using a cryptographic secret key. This signature ensures the token's integrity (it hasn't been tampered with) and authenticity (it was issued by our server).
*   **Token Expiration**: JWTs are configured with definite expiration times. Access tokens are short-lived (e.g., 15-30 minutes) to minimize the window of opportunity for compromise. Refresh tokens are longer-lived (e.g., days/weeks) but have a specific scope (`/api/auth/refresh` path) to limit their usage.
*   **HttpOnly Cookies**: The `authToken` and `refreshToken` cookies are set with the `HttpOnly` flag. This prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing these cookies, significantly mitigating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   **Secure Cookies**: The `Secure` flag ensures that the cookies are only transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections, protecting them from eavesdropping during transit.
*   **SameSite Cookies (`Lax`)**: The `SameSite=Lax` policy provides protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by limiting when cookies are sent with cross-site requests.
*   **Path-Specific Cookies**: The `authToken` is scoped to `/api` (or a more specific API root), while the `refreshToken` is scoped to `/api/auth/refresh`. This limits the exposure of these tokens to only the necessary API paths.
*   **Input Validation**: Although not explicitly detailed in the hierarchy, proper input validation is a standard security practice to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.

#### 7. Error Handling

The endpoint employs a structured approach to error handling to provide informative feedback to clients while protecting sensitive internal details:

*   **Authentication Failures**:
    *   If credentials (username/password) are incorrect, an `AuthenticationException` (or similar) is thrown by the `AuthenticationService`.
    *   This exception is caught by a centralized `ExceptionHandler` (e.g., a `@ControllerAdvice` in Spring).
    *   The error is logged internally with sufficient detail for debugging.
    *   A generic `401 Unauthorized` HTTP status code is returned to the client, along with a user-friendly message like "Invalid username or password," avoiding specifics that could aid attackers.
*   **Request Validation Errors**:
    *   If the request body is missing required fields or is malformed, validation errors are triggered.
    *   A `400 Bad Request` HTTP status code is returned.
    *   The error payload includes specific details about which fields are invalid or missing.
*   **Internal Server Errors**:
    *   Any unhandled exceptions (e.g., database connection issues, unexpected service failures) will typically result in a `500 Internal Server Error`.
    *   These errors are logged extensively on the server side.
    *   A generic error message is returned to the client to avoid exposing internal system details.

#### 8. Performance Considerations

The design of this endpoint incorporates several performance optimizations:

*   **Efficient User Lookup**: The `UserRepository.findByUsername` operation is critical. It's assumed that the `username` column in the database is indexed to ensure fast user record retrieval, minimizing database query time.
*   **Stateless JWTs**: By using JWTs and secure cookies, the server avoids maintaining traditional server-side sessions. This "stateless" approach reduces memory consumption on the server and improves scalability, as any server instance can validate a token without needing shared session state.
*   **Optimized Token Generation**: The JWT library used for token signing is designed for cryptographic efficiency. While signing is a CPU-bound operation, modern libraries are highly optimized.
*   **Minimal Response Payload**: The success response (`200 OK`) contains only essential information (e.g., a message) and does not include the tokens in the body, as they are delivered via cookies. This minimizes network data transfer.
*   **Metrics Collection (Assumption)**: It is assumed that this endpoint is integrated with a monitoring system to collect performance metrics (e.g., response times, success rates, error rates). This allows for proactive identification and resolution of performance bottlenecks.

#### 9. Usage Pattern

This endpoint serves as the primary authentication entry point for users accessing the application.

*   **Typical Use Case**: A user has a registered account and wishes to log in to access protected resources. They provide their username and password through a client application (e.g., a web browser's login form, a mobile application's login screen).
*   **Flow**:
    1.  The user enters credentials into the client application.
    2.  The client sends a `POST` request to `/api/v1/auth/login` with the username and password in the JSON body.
    3.  Upon successful authentication, the server responds with a `200 OK` status and includes the `authToken` and `refreshToken` as secure HTTP-only cookies.
    4.  The client's browser (or HTTP client) automatically stores these cookies.
    5.  For subsequent requests to protected API endpoints, the browser automatically attaches the `authToken` cookie (due to its path and domain configuration), allowing the server to authenticate the user for each request without requiring explicit header management from client-side JavaScript.
    6.  When the `authToken` expires, the client can use the `refreshToken` to request a new `authToken` from a dedicated refresh endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/auth/refresh`) without requiring the user to re-enter credentials.
*   **Prerequisites**:
    *   The user must have an existing account in the system.
    *   The client application must be capable of sending `application/json` requests and handling `Set-Cookie` headers from the server.
    *   The client's environment (e.g., web browser) must support and respect secure cookie attributes (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`).

#### 10. Additional Notes

*   The strategic use of two types of tokens (short-lived access, long-lived refresh) enhances security by limiting the lifespan of the primary access token, while still providing a seamless user experience through silent token renewal.
*   The distinct `Path` for the `refreshToken` cookie (`/api/auth/refresh`) enforces a security best practice: the refresh token should only be accessible by the endpoint specifically designed for token renewal, minimizing its exposure.
*   It is critically important that the JWT secret keys used for signing are securely managed (e.g., stored in environment variables, a secrets manager, or a key vault) and never hardcoded in the application's source code. Rotation of these keys should also be considered as a security practice.
*   CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration is crucial for web applications accessing this endpoint from a different origin. While not explicitly detailed in the call hierarchy, a robust CORS policy would be implemented at the controller or global level to allow legitimate client applications to interact with this endpoint.
