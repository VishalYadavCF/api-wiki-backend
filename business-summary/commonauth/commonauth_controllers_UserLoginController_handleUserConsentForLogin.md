## API Endpoint Documentation: User Login

### 1. Endpoint Overview

*   **Endpoint Path**: `/api/v1/auth/login`
*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Consumes**: `application/json`
*   **Produces**: `application/json`
*   **Purpose**: This endpoint facilitates user authentication. Upon successful verification of credentials, it issues an access token and a refresh token, establishing a secure session for subsequent API requests.
*   **Controller Method**: `AuthController.login(LoginRequest loginRequest)`
*   **Primary Function**: Handles user login requests, performs credential validation, generates secure JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), and sets them as HttpOnly, Secure cookies to establish a user session.

### 2. Request and Response

**Request Type**: `LoginRequest` (JSON Payload)

*   **Structure**:
    ```json
    {
      "username": "string",
      "password": "string"
    }
    ```
*   **Parameters**:
    *   `username` (string, required): The user's unique identifier (e.g., email or username).
    *   `password` (string, required): The user's plain-text password.

**Response Type**: `ResponseEntity<LoginResponse>` (JSON Payload and HTTP Headers)

*   **Success Response (HTTP Status: 200 OK)**:
    *   **Payload Structure**:
        ```json
        {
          "message": "Login successful. Tokens provided via cookies.",
          "username": "user_identifier"
        }
        ```
    *   **HTTP Headers**:
        *   `Set-Cookie`: Contains two cookies:
            *   `accessToken`: The short-lived JWT, crucial for authenticating subsequent API calls. Configured as `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Lax`.
            *   `refreshToken`: The longer-lived JWT, used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires. Configured as `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Lax`.
    *   **Success Details**: A success message is returned in the JSON body, indicating successful authentication. The actual tokens are securely transmitted via `Set-Cookie` headers, preventing client-side JavaScript access.

### 3. Call Hierarchy

The `AuthController.login` method orchestrates a series of internal service calls to handle the authentication flow. Below is a detailed breakdown of the execution path:

1.  **`AuthController.login(LoginRequest loginRequest)`**
    *   **Role**: The primary entry point for the login request. It receives the `LoginRequest` payload and delegates to various services for processing.
    *   **Invokes**: `RequestValidationService.validate(loginRequest)`

2.  **`RequestValidationService.validate(loginRequest)`**
    *   **Role**: Ensures that the incoming `LoginRequest` payload is syntactically correct and adheres to predefined data constraints (e.g., email format, password complexity rules).
    *   **Key Operations**: Checks for mandatory fields, validates data types, and applies business-specific validation rules.
    *   **Invokes**: Internal `Validator` utility methods (e.g., `Validator.isValidEmail`, `Validator.isStrongPassword`).
    *   **Outputs**: Throws a `ValidationException` if validation fails, otherwise proceeds.

3.  **`AuthenticationService.authenticate(username, password)`**
    *   **Role**: Verifies the user's credentials against the stored user data. This is the core authentication logic.
    *   **Key Operations**:
        *   Retrieves user details based on the provided username.
        *   Compares the provided plain-text password with the securely hashed password stored in the database.
    *   **Invokes**:
        *   `UserService.findByUsername(username)`
            *   **Role**: Fetches user data from the persistence layer.
            *   **Invokes**: `UserRepository.findByUsername(username)` (Database operation)
        *   `PasswordEncoder.matches(rawPassword, encodedPassword)` (from Spring Security or similar library)
            *   **Role**: Safely compares the user-provided password with the stored hashed password without exposing the raw password.
    *   **Outputs**: Returns a `User` object if authentication is successful; otherwise, throws an `AuthenticationException`.

4.  **`TokenService.generateTokens(user)`**
    *   **Role**: Responsible for creating and managing the access and refresh tokens for the authenticated user.
    *   **Key Operations**: Generates JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) with specific claims and expiration times.
    *   **Invokes**:
        *   `JwtTokenProvider.createAccessToken(user, roles, expiration)`: Creates the short-lived access token.
        *   `JwtTokenProvider.createRefreshToken(user, expiration)`: Creates the long-lived refresh token.
        *   `TokenStoreService.saveRefreshToken(refreshToken)`: Persists the refresh token to allow for revocation or session management.
            *   **Invokes**: `RefreshTokenRepository.save(refreshTokenEntity)` (Database operation)
    *   **Outputs**: Returns an object containing both the generated access token and refresh token strings.

5.  **`CookieService.createAuthCookies(accessToken, refreshToken)`**
    *   **Role**: Constructs the secure HTTP cookies that will carry the access and refresh tokens back to the client.
    *   **Key Operations**: Configures cookie properties such as `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`, and `expiration`.
    *   **Invokes**: `CookieBuilder.buildHttpOnlySecureCookie(name, value, expiration)` (utility method)
    *   **Outputs**: Returns a list of `javax.servlet.http.Cookie` objects ready to be added to the HTTP response.

6.  **`ResponseBuilder.buildLoginSuccessResponse(accessToken, refreshToken)`**
    *   **Role**: Assembles the final HTTP response, including the status code, body, and all generated cookies.
    *   **Key Operations**: Creates a `LoginResponse` object for the JSON body and adds the generated cookies to the `ResponseEntity`'s headers.
    *   **Outputs**: A `ResponseEntity` object with HTTP 200 OK status, a success message in the body, and the `Set-Cookie` headers.

### 4. Key Operations

*   **Request Validation**: Ensures the incoming login request has all necessary fields and that they are correctly formatted, preventing malformed data from progressing through the system.
*   **User Authentication**: Verifies the provided username and password against the system's user store, leveraging secure password hashing for comparison.
*   **Token Generation**: Creates cryptographically signed JWTs (Access and Refresh tokens) that encapsulate user identity and permissions, enabling stateless authentication.
*   **Refresh Token Persistence**: Stores the generated refresh token in the database. This allows the system to revoke tokens if necessary and facilitates the issuance of new access tokens without requiring re-authentication by the user.
*   **Secure Cookie Management**: Encapsulates the generated tokens within `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` cookies, ensuring secure transmission and preventing client-side JavaScript access or Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   **Response Construction**: Builds a standardized success response, delivering the tokens securely via HTTP headers and providing a clear status message.

### 6. Security Features

*   **Password Hashing**: User passwords are never stored or transmitted in plain text. A strong, one-way hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt via `PasswordEncoder`) is used to store and compare passwords, protecting against database breaches.
*   **JWT Security**:
    *   **Signing**: JWTs are digitally signed using a strong secret key (HMAC) or public/private key pair (RSA/ECC) to ensure their integrity and authenticity. Any tampering is detectable.
    *   **Expiration**: Both access and refresh tokens have predefined expiration times, limiting the window of opportunity for token compromise. Access tokens are short-lived to minimize damage from leakage.
*   **Secure Cookies**:
    *   **HttpOnly**: Prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie's value, mitigating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
    *   **Secure**: Ensures the cookie is only sent over encrypted HTTPS connections, preventing interception.
    *   **SameSite=Lax**: Provides protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by restricting when the browser sends the cookie with cross-site requests.
*   **Input Validation**: Strict validation of `username` and `password` inputs prevents common attacks like SQL injection, XSS, and buffer overflows by rejecting malformed or malicious data.
*   **Error Obfuscation**: Generic error messages are returned to the client in case of authentication failure or internal errors, preventing information disclosure that could aid attackers.
*   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: While not directly part of the `login` method's hierarchy, the API likely employs a global CORS configuration to define which origins are allowed to make requests, preventing unauthorized cross-origin access.

### 7. Error Handling

Error handling within this endpoint is robust, providing clear feedback to the client while protecting sensitive internal information.

*   **Validation Errors**: If the `RequestValidationService` identifies invalid input (e.g., missing fields, incorrect format), a `ValidationException` is thrown. This typically results in a `400 Bad Request` HTTP status with a detailed error message in the response body, indicating which input field failed validation.
*   **Authentication Failures**: If `AuthenticationService` cannot verify the credentials (e.g., username not found, incorrect password), an `AuthenticationException` is thrown. This translates to a `401 Unauthorized` HTTP status, usually with a generic message like "Invalid credentials" to avoid revealing whether the username or password was specifically incorrect.
*   **Internal Server Errors**: Any unexpected exceptions or failures within the underlying services (e.g., database connection issues, token generation errors) are caught and typically result in a `500 Internal Server Error` HTTP status. These errors are logged extensively on the server-side with stack traces for debugging but present a generic error message to the client to avoid information leakage.
*   **Logging**: All errors, regardless of type, are logged to the application's logging system (e.g., Logback) with appropriate severity levels (e.g., `WARN` for validation/authentication failures, `ERROR` for critical system errors). This enables monitoring and troubleshooting.
*   **Centralized Handling**: The system likely uses a centralized error handling mechanism (e.g., Spring's `@ControllerAdvice`) to standardize error responses across all API endpoints.

### 8. Performance Considerations

*   **Efficient Credential Verification**: While password hashing is computationally intensive, the system utilizes optimized hashing algorithms. User lookup from the database (`UserRepository`) is typically indexed for fast retrieval.
*   **Minimal Database Operations**: The endpoint limits database interactions to a single user lookup and a single refresh token save, minimizing I/O overhead.
*   **Fast Token Generation**: JWT signing and encoding are highly optimized operations, ensuring quick token issuance.
*   **Cookie Size Optimization**: While JWTs can be large, the system ensures that the overall cookie size remains within acceptable browser limits.
*   **Metrics Collection**: The system is likely configured to collect performance metrics (e.g., using Spring Boot Actuator with Prometheus/Grafana) to monitor endpoint latency, throughput, and error rates, enabling proactive identification and resolution of performance bottlenecks.

### 9. Usage Pattern

This endpoint is the initial step for any user or client application that requires authenticated access to the system's resources.

*   **Typical Use Case**: A user enters their username and password on a web or mobile application's login screen. The application then sends these credentials as a `POST` request to `/api/v1/auth/login`.
*   **Prerequisites**: The user must have a registered account with a valid username and password in the system. Network connectivity to the API gateway is required.
*   **Session Establishment**: Upon a successful response, the client application does not need to explicitly parse tokens from the response body. Instead, the browser automatically stores the `accessToken` and `refreshToken` cookies. For subsequent API calls, the browser will automatically include these cookies, and the backend API gateway or individual microservices will validate the `accessToken` for authentication.
*   **Token Refresh**: When the `accessToken` expires, the client application (or a dedicated refresh mechanism) can use the `refreshToken` with a separate endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/auth/refresh-token`) to obtain a new `accessToken` without requiring the user to re-enter credentials.

### 10. Additional Notes

*   **Refresh Token Strategy**: This implementation implies a server-side storage of refresh tokens, which is a good practice for enabling token revocation (e.g., logging out all devices). The system might employ a single-use or rotating refresh token strategy, where a new refresh token is issued with every access token refresh.
*   **Stateless Authentication**: By using JWTs and secure cookies, the system largely maintains a stateless session on the server-side, reducing server memory footprint and simplifying horizontal scaling.
*   **Environment Configuration**: The JWT secret keys, token expiration times, and cookie domain settings are critical security parameters that must be securely managed and configured per environment (development, staging, production). These should typically be loaded from environment variables or a secure configuration management system.
*   **Client-Side Security**: While the backend handles token security, client applications should also adhere to best practices (e.g., using secure HTTP clients, not attempting to access `HttpOnly` cookies via JavaScript, protecting sensitive data on the client).
