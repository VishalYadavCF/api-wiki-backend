## API Endpoint Documentation: User Authentication & Token Generation

This document describes the `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint, which is responsible for authenticating user credentials and issuing secure access tokens and refresh tokens for subsequent API interactions.

---

### 1. Endpoint Overview

*   **Endpoint Path**: `/api/v1/auth/login`
*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Consumes**: `application/json` (expected input payload)
*   **Produces**: `application/json` (returned response payload)
*   **Purpose**: This endpoint allows users to authenticate themselves by providing their credentials (username and password). Upon successful authentication, it generates and issues a short-lived access token and a long-lived refresh token. These tokens are crucial for establishing and maintaining secure sessions, granting access to protected resources, and facilitating seamless re-authentication without requiring users to re-enter their credentials frequently.
*   **Controller Method**: `AuthLoginController.login(LoginRequest request)`
*   **Primary Function**: Handles user authentication, token generation (JWT), cookie management for secure token storage, and basic auditing.

### 2. Request and Response

**Request Type**: `application/json`
The request body is a JSON object containing the user's authentication credentials.

*   **Payload Structure (Example `LoginRequest`)**:
    ```json
    {
      "username": "user.email@example.com",
      "password": "SecurePassword123!"
    }
    ```
    *   `username` (String, required): The user's unique identifier, typically an email address or a unique username.
    *   `password` (String, required): The user's plaintext password. This is only transmitted over HTTPS and never stored in plain text.

**Response Type**: `application/json`
Upon successful authentication, the API returns a JSON object containing token details and sets secure HTTP-only cookies.

*   **Success Response**:
    *   **HTTP Status Code**: `200 OK`
    *   **Payload Structure (Example `AuthLoginResponse`)**:
        ```json
        {
          "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1Ni...",
          "refreshToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1Ni...",
          "tokenType": "Bearer",
          "expiresIn": 3600, // Access token validity in seconds (1 hour)
          "user": {
            "id": "uuid-of-user",
            "username": "user.email@example.com",
            "roles": ["USER", "ADMIN"]
          }
        }
        ```
        *   `accessToken` (String): A JWT used for authenticating subsequent requests to protected resources. It has a short expiration time.
        *   `refreshToken` (String): A JWT used to obtain a new access token once the current one expires, without requiring re-authentication with credentials. It has a longer expiration time.
        *   `tokenType` (String): Indicates the type of token, typically "Bearer".
        *   `expiresIn` (Number): The validity period of the `accessToken` in seconds.
        *   `user` (Object): Basic user profile information, including `id`, `username`, and `roles`.
    *   **Headers**:
        *   `Content-Type`: `application/json`
    *   **Cookies**:
        *   `access_token` (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax): Contains the access token for browser-based clients.
        *   `refresh_token` (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax): Contains the refresh token for browser-based clients.
        *   These cookies are essential for maintaining session state securely, preventing client-side JavaScript access to tokens, and mitigating CSRF attacks.

    *   **Inputs**: `username`.
    *   **Operations**: Logs the successful login attempt with relevant details (e.g., timestamp, IP address, user agent).

### 4. Key Operations

*   **Request Validation**: Ensures the incoming `LoginRequest` payload is well-formed and contains the necessary credentials. This prevents common errors and potential security vulnerabilities.
*   **User Authentication**: The core process of verifying the user's identity by comparing the provided password against the securely stored hashed password. This is critical for security.
*   **Token Generation (JWT)**: Creation of signed JSON Web Tokens (access and refresh). These tokens are the foundation of stateless authentication, allowing clients to prove their identity without re-sending credentials on every request.
*   **Cookie Management**: Securely setting `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` cookies for access and refresh tokens. This prevents client-side script access to tokens (mitigating XSS) and ensures tokens are only sent over HTTPS to the same site (mitigating CSRF).
*   **Auditing**: Logging successful (and potentially failed) login attempts provides a crucial trail for security monitoring, compliance, and debugging.

### 5. Dependencies

*   **Request/Response Entities**:
    *   `LoginRequest`: Data Transfer Object (DTO) for incoming user credentials.
    *   `AuthLoginResponse`: DTO for outgoing token and user information.
    *   `UserDetails` (or similar): Interface/class representing authenticated user details (e.g., from Spring Security).
    *   `UserEntity`: Database entity representing a user record.
*   **Services/Libraries**:
    *   `AuthService`: Encapsulates core authentication business logic.
    *   `JwtService`: Handles all JWT-related operations (generation, validation, parsing).
    *   `CookieService`: Manages setting and clearing secure cookies.
    *   `AuditService`: For logging security-relevant events.
    *   `UserRepository`: Data Access Object (DAO) for interacting with the user database table.
    *   `PasswordEncoder`: Cryptographic utility for password hashing and comparison (e.g., from Spring Security Crypto).
    *   **JWT Library**: (e.g., `jjwt`, `Auth0 JWT`) for JWT creation and signing.
*   **Database**:
    *   `Users` table: Stores user credentials (hashed passwords), roles, and other profile information.
*   **Frameworks/Utilities**:
    *   **Spring Boot/Spring Framework**: Provides the foundational application context, dependency injection, and web capabilities.
    *   **Spring Security**: Handles authentication, authorization, password encoding, and potentially session management.
    *   **Logging Framework**: (e.g., SLF4J, Logback) for application and audit logging.
    *   **Validation API**: (e.g., Jakarta Bean Validation) for input payload validation.

### 6. Security Features

*   **Password Hashing**: User passwords are never stored or transmitted in plain text. They are hashed using a strong, one-way cryptographic algorithm (e.g., BCrypt) with a salt, making them irreversible and resistant to rainbow table attacks.
*   **JWT Security**:
    *   **Digital Signing**: JWTs are digitally signed using a secret key, ensuring their integrity (cannot be tampered with) and authenticity (issued by the legitimate server).
    *   **Expiration**: Both access and refresh tokens have predefined expiration times. Access tokens are short-lived (e.g., 1 hour) to minimize the impact of token compromise, while refresh tokens are longer-lived (e.g., 7-30 days) to facilitate re-authentication.
*   **Cookie Security**:
    *   **`HttpOnly`**: Tokens stored in cookies are marked `HttpOnly`, preventing client-side JavaScript from accessing them. This significantly mitigates Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
    *   **`Secure`**: Cookies are marked `Secure`, ensuring they are only sent over encrypted HTTPS connections, protecting them from eavesdropping.
    *   **`SameSite=Lax`**: The `SameSite` attribute helps mitigate Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by instructing browsers to only send cookies with same-site requests, or only for top-level navigations (for `Lax`).
*   **Input Validation**: Strict validation of incoming request payloads prevents injection attacks and ensures data integrity.
*   **CORS Handling**: Proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration ensures that only authorized frontend origins can make requests to this endpoint, preventing unauthorized cross-origin requests.
*   **Audit Logging**: Detailed logging of login attempts provides forensic capabilities in case of security incidents.

### 7. Error Handling

The endpoint is designed to gracefully handle various error conditions, providing informative feedback to the client while logging detailed errors internally.

*   **Types of Errors Handled**:
    *   **Bad Request (400)**:
        *   **Invalid Input**: Missing required fields (`username`, `password`) or malformed JSON payload.
        *   **Specific Validation Failures**: (e.g., username format, password strength not met if pre-validated).
    *   **Unauthorized (401)**:
        *   **Invalid Credentials**: Username not found or password mismatch.
    *   **Internal Server Error (500)**:
        *   **Database Connectivity Issues**: Failure to connect to the `Users` table.
        *   **Token Generation Failure**: Issues with the JWT signing process.
        *   **Service Unavailability**: Any unexpected runtime exception within the called services (`AuthService`, `JwtService`, etc.).
*   **Error Response Structure**:
    ```json
    {
      "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:30:00Z",
      "status": 401,
      "error": "Unauthorized",
      "message": "Invalid username or password.",
      "path": "/api/v1/auth/login"
    }
    ```
    *   `timestamp` (String): The time the error occurred.
    *   `status` (Number): The HTTP status code.
    *   `error` (String): A short, descriptive error type.
    *   `message` (String): A developer-friendly message explaining the error.
    *   `path` (String): The API endpoint path that was called.
*   **Logging**: All errors are logged internally with sufficient detail (e.g., stack traces for 500 errors) to aid in debugging and monitoring, but sensitive details are not exposed to the client.
*   **Re-throwing/Wrapping**: Specific exceptions from lower layers (e.g., `UsernameNotFoundException` from `UserRepository`) are caught and translated into appropriate, more general authentication exceptions or HTTP responses by the `AuthService` or `AuthLoginController`.

### 8. Performance Considerations

*   **Efficient Password Hashing**: While password hashing is computationally intensive by design (to prevent brute-force attacks), the `PasswordEncoder` is optimized for performance without compromising security.
*   **Fast Token Generation**: JWT generation and signing are highly optimized operations, designed to be fast and stateless, avoiding database lookups for every token issuance.
*   **Minimal Cookie Overhead**: The cookies contain only the necessary token strings, minimizing the size of headers sent with every request.
*   **Database Query Optimization**: The `UserRepository.findByUsername()` query is expected to be indexed on the `username` column for rapid user lookup.
*   **Metrics Collection**: The endpoint is instrumented with metrics (e.g., request duration, success/failure rates, error counts) to allow for real-time monitoring of performance and health. This helps identify bottlenecks and ensure responsiveness under load.

### 9. Usage Pattern

This endpoint is typically the **first API call a user makes after entering their login credentials** on a client application (e.g., web frontend, mobile app).

*   **Prerequisites**:
    *   The user must have a pre-existing account registered in the system.
    *   The client application must be capable of sending `POST` requests with JSON payloads and handling HTTP-only cookies (for browser-based clients) or parsing JSON responses to store tokens locally (for mobile/desktop apps).
    *   The client application should implement HTTPS to ensure secure communication.
*   **Workflow**:
    1.  User inputs `username` and `password` in the client application's login form.
    2.  The client sends a `POST` request to `/api/v1/auth/login` with the credentials in the JSON body.
    3.  Upon receiving a `200 OK` response:
        *   For browser clients, the secure `access_token` and `refresh_token` cookies are automatically set by the browser.
        *   For non-browser clients (e.g., mobile apps), the `accessToken` and `refreshToken` from the JSON response are extracted and stored securely (e.g., in secure storage).
    4.  The client can then use the `accessToken` (either via the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header or via the `access_token` cookie) for all subsequent authenticated API requests to protected resources.
    5.  When the `accessToken` expires, the client can use the `refreshToken` with a separate endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/auth/refresh-token`) to obtain a new access token without requiring re-authentication.

### 10. Additional Notes

*   **HTTPS Enforcement**: This endpoint, like all authentication-related endpoints, is strictly enforced to be accessible only over HTTPS to prevent credentials and tokens from being intercepted.
*   **Rate Limiting**: It is highly recommended to implement rate limiting on this endpoint to mitigate brute-force password guessing attacks. (Assumption: This might be handled by an API Gateway or a separate security layer).
*   **Password Policy**: The system implicitly relies on a strong password policy for user accounts, which is enforced during user registration to enhance overall security.
*   **Token Revocation**: While not directly handled by this *login* endpoint, the system should have a mechanism for server-side token revocation (especially for refresh tokens) in case of security breaches or user logout events.
