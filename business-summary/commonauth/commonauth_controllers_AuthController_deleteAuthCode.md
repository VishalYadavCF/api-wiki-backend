### API Endpoint Documentation: User Authentication & Token Generation

This document describes the `/auth/token` API endpoint, responsible for authenticating users and issuing authentication tokens.

#### 1. Endpoint Overview

*   **Endpoint Path**: `/auth/token`
*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Consumes**: `application/json`
*   **Produces**: `application/json` (for status/message), `text/plain` (implicitly for the JWT token if not delivered via cookie)
*   **Controller Method**: `authController.generateAuthToken`
*   **Primary Function**: Authenticates a user based on provided credentials and, upon successful authentication, generates a JSON Web Token (JWT) and sets it as a secure HTTP-only cookie, signaling a successful session establishment.

#### 2. Request and Response

*   **Request Type**:
    *   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
    *   **Payload Structure**: `application/json`
        ```json
        {
          "username": "user@example.com",
          "password": "securepassword123"
        }
        ```
    *   **Input Parameters**: Requires a JSON body containing `username` (string) and `password` (string) fields.
*   **Success Response Details**:
    *   **Status Code**: `200 OK`
    *   **Payload**: `application/json`
        ```json
        {
          "message": "Authentication successful"
        }
        ```
        *Note*: The primary authentication token (JWT) is delivered via a secure HTTP-only cookie, not directly in the JSON payload, enhancing security.
    *   **Headers**:
        *   `Content-Type: application/json`
        *   `Set-Cookie`: Contains the authentication JWT, configured as `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Lax`. Example: `AUTH_TOKEN=ey...; Path=/; Expires=Tue, 19 Dec 2023 12:00:00 GMT; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax`
    *   **Cookies**: One `Set-Cookie` header for the authentication token.

#### 3. Call Hierarchy

The `generateAuthToken` endpoint orchestrates a series of operations to validate credentials, generate a token, and establish a session.

1.  **`authController.generateAuthToken(authRequest)`**
    *   **Purpose**: The primary entry point for user authentication requests. It receives the `authRequest` (containing username and password) and coordinates subsequent service calls.
    *   **Key Operations**:
        *   **Request Validation**: Performs initial validation on the `authRequest` object to ensure `username` and `password` are present and meet basic criteria (e.g., non-null, non-empty).
        *   **Delegates Authentication**: Calls `authenticationService.authenticate` to verify user credentials.
        *   **Delegates Token Generation**: If authentication is successful, calls `jwtService.generateToken` to create a JWT.
        *   **Delegates Cookie Creation**: Calls `cookieService.createAuthCookie` to encapsulate the JWT into a secure cookie.
        *   **Response Construction**: Adds the generated cookie to the HTTP response and returns a success `ResponseEntity`.

2.  **`authenticationService.authenticate(username, password)`**
    *   **Purpose**: Manages the core logic for authenticating user credentials against the stored user data.
    *   **Inputs**: `username` (string), `password` (string).
    *   **Outputs**: Authenticated `UserDetails` object (or throws an exception on failure).
    *   **Key Operations**:
        *   **User Details Retrieval**: Calls `userDetailsService.loadUserByUsername(username)` to fetch the stored user details, including the hashed password and user roles, from the database.
            *   *Error Handling*: If the user is not found, a `UsernameNotFoundException` is thrown, indicating invalid credentials.
        *   **Password Comparison**: Uses `passwordEncoder.matches(rawPassword, encodedPassword)` to securely compare the provided raw password with the hashed password retrieved from the database.
            *   *Error Handling*: If passwords do not match, a `BadCredentialsException` is thrown.
        *   **Returns Authenticated User**: If both steps succeed, returns the `UserDetails` object, confirming successful authentication.

3.  **`jwtService.generateToken(userDetails)`**
    *   **Purpose**: Responsible for creating a cryptographically signed JSON Web Token (JWT) containing essential user information.
    *   **Inputs**: Authenticated `UserDetails` object.
    *   **Outputs**: Signed JWT string.
    *   **Key Operations**:
        *   **Claim Construction**: Gathers necessary information from `userDetails` (e.g., username, roles) to create JWT claims (subject, issued at, expiration time).
        *   **Token Signing**: Cryptographically signs the JWT using a pre-configured secret key and an appropriate signing algorithm (e.g., HMAC SHA-256).
        *   **Token String Generation**: Serializes the JWT header, claims, and signature into the standard JWT string format.

4.  **`cookieService.createAuthCookie(jwtToken)`**
    *   **Purpose**: Encapsulates the generated JWT into an `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` compliant HTTP cookie.
    *   **Inputs**: Signed JWT string.
    *   **Outputs**: A `ResponseCookie` object ready to be added to the HTTP response.
    *   **Key Operations**:
        *   **Cookie Attributes Setting**: Configures the cookie with critical security attributes:
            *   `HttpOnly`: Prevents client-side scripts from accessing the cookie, mitigating XSS attacks.
            *   `Secure`: Ensures the cookie is only sent over HTTPS connections, protecting against eavesdropping.
            *   `SameSite=Lax`: Provides a reasonable balance for CSRF protection, allowing cookies to be sent with top-level navigations.
        *   **Expiration Alignment**: Sets the cookie's expiration time to match the JWT's expiration, ensuring synchronized validity.
        *   **Path Definition**: Sets the cookie path (e.g., `/`) to determine its scope across the application.

#### 4. Key Operations

The endpoint primarily performs the following critical operations:

*   **Request Validation**: Ensures the incoming `authRequest` contains valid and expected input fields.
*   **User Authentication**: Verifies the identity of the user by comparing provided credentials against stored user data. This involves looking up user details and securely validating the password.
*   **JWT Generation**: Creates a secure, signed JSON Web Token containing identity and session information for the authenticated user. This token serves as proof of authentication for subsequent requests.
*   **Secure Cookie Management**: Embeds the generated JWT into a highly secure cookie (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax`) to be sent back to the client. This is the primary mechanism for session management and token delivery.
*   **Response Construction**: Formulates the appropriate HTTP response, including status code, an informational JSON payload, and the crucial `Set-Cookie` header.

#### 5. Dependencies

*   **Request/Response Entities**:
    *   `AuthRequest` (DTO): Represents the incoming JSON payload for username and password.
    *   `UserDetails` (Interface/Class): Represents the authenticated user's details (e.g., username, roles, password) retrieved from the user store.
    *   `ResponseEntity` (Framework Class): Used to construct the HTTP response.
    *   `ResponseCookie` (Framework Class): Used to construct the secure cookie.
*   **Services/Libraries Used**:
    *   `AuthenticationService`: Core business logic for user authentication.
    *   `UserDetailsService`: Interface/Service for loading user-specific data (e.g., Spring Security's `UserDetailsService`).
    *   `JwtService`: Responsible for JWT creation and signing.
    *   `CookieService`: Utility for creating secure cookies.
    *   `PasswordEncoder`: For hashing and comparing passwords securely (e.g., BCryptPasswordEncoder).
*   **Database Entities/Tables Involved**:
    *   Typically, a `users` table or similar entity storing user credentials (hashed password, username) and roles.
*   **Frameworks/Utilities**:
    *   Spring Framework (Spring Boot, Spring Web, Spring Security): Provides the foundational components for controller, services, and security.
    *   JWT Library (e.g., JJWT): For JWT generation and signing.
    *   Logging Utilities: For recording events and errors (e.g., SLF4J/Logback).

#### 6. Security Features

*   **Password Hashing**: Passwords are never stored in plain text. `passwordEncoder.matches` ensures that provided passwords are compared against securely hashed versions, preventing exposure of credentials in case of a data breach.
*   **JWT Signing**: The JWTs are cryptographically signed using a secret key. This ensures the token's integrity (it hasn't been tampered with) and authenticity (it was issued by the trusted server).
*   **JWT Expiration**: JWTs are issued with a defined expiration time. This limits the window of opportunity for token misuse if stolen. The cookie's expiration is aligned with the JWT's.
*   **HttpOnly Cookies**: The authentication cookie is marked as `HttpOnly`, which means it cannot be accessed or modified by client-side JavaScript. This significantly reduces the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks stealing the session token.
*   **Secure Cookies**: The cookie is marked as `Secure`, ensuring it is only transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections. This protects the token from eavesdropping during transit.
*   **SameSite=Lax Cookies**: The cookie uses `SameSite=Lax` policy, which helps mitigate Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by preventing the cookie from being sent with cross-site requests unless they are top-level navigations.
*   **Input Validation**: Initial validation of the `authRequest` helps prevent common injection attacks and ensures proper data format.

#### 7. Error Handling

*   **Invalid Input**: If the `authRequest` is malformed or missing required fields (e.g., empty username/password), the initial validation step will catch this, typically resulting in a `400 Bad Request` or `422 Unprocessable Entity` response with an informative error message.
*   **Authentication Failures**:
    *   `UsernameNotFoundException`: Thrown if the provided username does not correspond to an existing user.
    *   `BadCredentialsException`: Thrown if the provided password does not match the stored password for the given username.
    *   Both of these exceptions are usually caught by a global exception handler and translated into a `401 Unauthorized` HTTP status code, often with a generic message like "Invalid Credentials" to prevent enumeration of valid usernames.
*   **Internal Server Errors**: Any unexpected exceptions during database operations, JWT generation, or other internal processes will typically be caught by a global exception handler, logged internally, and returned to the client as a `500 Internal Server Error` with a generic message to avoid exposing sensitive internal details.
*   **Logging**: All errors (validation, authentication, and internal) are thoroughly logged internally to aid in debugging and monitoring.

#### 8. Performance Considerations

*   **Efficient Database Operations**: The `userDetailsService.loadUserByUsername` method is expected to be optimized for fast user lookups (e.g., indexed `username` column in the database).
*   **Optimized Password Hashing**: `passwordEncoder.matches` is designed to be computationally intensive enough to deter brute-force attacks but efficient enough to not be a bottleneck for individual requests.
*   **Minimal Response Payload**: The success response JSON payload is intentionally minimal (`{"message": "Authentication successful"}`) to reduce network overhead. The JWT is delivered via a header, which is standard practice.
*   **Cookie Size Management**: The JWT size is kept reasonable to minimize HTTP header overhead, though modern browsers typically handle larger headers well.
*   **Metrics Collection**: It's highly recommended to integrate metrics collection (e.g., via Micrometer/Prometheus) to monitor response times, error rates, and throughput for this critical endpoint, allowing for proactive performance tuning.

#### 9. Usage Pattern

This endpoint is the initial step for a user to gain access to protected resources within the application.

*   **Typical Use Case**: It is called by client applications (e.g., web browser, mobile app, desktop application) after a user provides their username and password on a login screen.
*   **Context**: It establishes the user's session with the backend, allowing subsequent requests to be authenticated using the issued JWT stored in the secure cookie.
*   **Prerequisites**:
    1.  The user must have an existing account registered in the system.
    2.  The client application must be able to handle HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite cookies (which is standard for web browsers). For non-browser clients, the JWT would typically be extracted from the cookie header and managed manually (e.g., stored in memory for subsequent `Authorization: Bearer` headers).

#### 10. Additional Notes

*   **CORS Policy**: Proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration is essential for this endpoint if the client application is hosted on a different domain. The server should allow `POST` requests from trusted origins.
*   **Rate Limiting**: For production environments, it is highly recommended to implement rate limiting on this endpoint to mitigate brute-force password guessing attacks.
*   **Token Refresh**: This endpoint only handles initial token generation. A separate mechanism (e.g., a refresh token endpoint) might be needed for long-lived sessions to issue new access tokens without requiring re-authentication by the user. (This is an assumption, as no refresh token mechanism is specified in the hierarchy).
