### API Endpoint: `/api/v1/auth/login`

#### 1. Endpoint Overview

*   **Endpoint Path**: `/api/v1/auth/login`
*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Consumes**: `application/json` (for login credentials)
*   **Produces**: `application/json` (for login success confirmation) and `Set-Cookie` headers
*   **Purpose**: This endpoint is responsible for authenticating user credentials, generating secure JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for both access and refresh purposes, and securely setting these tokens as HTTP-only cookies in the client's browser. It serves as the primary login mechanism for users to establish an authenticated session.
*   **Controller Method**: `AuthController.authenticateUser`
*   **Primary Function**: User authentication, JWT token generation, and secure session establishment via cookies.

#### 2. Request and Response

*   **Request Type**:
    *   **Method**: `POST`
    *   **URL**: `/api/v1/auth/login`
    *   **Headers**:
        *   `Content-Type: application/json`
    *   **Payload (JSON Body)**:
        ```json
        {
          "username": "user@example.com",
          "password": "securepassword123",
          "deviceId": "unique-device-identifier-123" // Optional, but recommended for refresh token management
        }
        ```
        *   `username` (String): The user's registered username or email.
        *   `password` (String): The user's plain-text password.
        *   `deviceId` (String, Optional): A unique identifier for the device or client application, used to manage refresh tokens securely.

    *   **Headers**:
        *   `Content-Type: application/json`
        *   `Set-Cookie`: Two `Set-Cookie` headers will be present, one for the access token and one for the refresh token. These cookies will be configured with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Lax` policies.
    *   **Payload (JSON Body)**:
        ```json
        {
          "message": "Login successful",
          "accessTokenExpiresIn": 3600 // Example: Access token validity in seconds
        }
        ```
        *   `message` (String): A confirmation message.
        *   `accessTokenExpiresIn` (Number): The expiration time of the access token in seconds. (Note: The `accessToken` itself is not returned in the JSON body for security reasons, only in the HttpOnly cookie.)

#### 3. Call Hierarchy

The following details the sequence of method calls and their responsibilities within the `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint:

*   `AuthController.authenticateUser(LoginRequest loginRequest, HttpServletResponse response)`
    *   **Role**: Entry point for the API request. It parses the incoming `LoginRequest`, initiates the authentication process, handles token generation and persistence, and sets the secure cookies in the HTTP response.
    *   **Invokes**:
        *   `AuthService.authenticate(loginRequest.getUsername(), loginRequest.getPassword())`
            *   **Role**: Core authentication logic. It validates user credentials and prepares the authenticated `Authentication` object.
            *   **Invokes**:
                *   `AuthenticationManager.authenticate(UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken)`
                    *   **Role**: Standard Spring Security component for processing authentication requests. It delegates to specific authentication providers.
                    *   **Internally Invokes**:
                        *   `CustomUserDetailsService.loadUserByUsername(username)`
                            *   **Role**: Retrieves user details (including hashed password and roles) from the underlying data store based on the provided username.
                            *   **Invokes**:
                                *   `UserRepository.findByUsername(username)`
                                    *   **Role**: Performs a database query to fetch the user entity by their username.
                        *   `PasswordEncoder.matches(rawPassword, encodedPassword)`
                            *   **Role**: Securely compares the plain-text password provided by the user with the hashed password retrieved from the database.
        *   `JwtTokenProvider.createAccessToken(Authentication authentication)`
            *   **Role**: Generates a short-lived JSON Web Token (JWT) used for immediate authorization of subsequent API calls.
        *   `JwtTokenProvider.createRefreshToken(Authentication authentication)`
            *   **Role**: Generates a longer-lived JWT used to obtain new access tokens once the current one expires, without requiring re-authentication.
        *   `RefreshTokenService.saveRefreshToken(refreshToken, authentication.getName(), loginRequest.getDeviceId())`
            *   **Role**: Persists the generated refresh token in the database, associating it with the user and a specific device identifier. This is crucial for managing refresh token validity and revocation.
            *   **Invokes**:
                *   `RefreshTokenRepository.save(refreshTokenEntity)`
                    *   **Role**: Database operation to store the refresh token entity.
        *   `CookieService.addCookie(response, "accessToken", accessToken, jwtExpirationSeconds, true, true, "Lax")`
            *   **Role**: Adds the access token to the HTTP response as a secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookie.
        *   `CookieService.addCookie(response, "refreshToken", refreshToken, refreshTokenExpirationSeconds, true, true, "Lax")`
            *   **Role**: Adds the refresh token to the HTTP response as a secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookie.
        *   `AuthResponseConverter.toLoginResponse(accessToken, jwtExpirationSeconds)`
            *   **Role**: Transforms the internal token information into the external JSON response structure, indicating successful login and token expiration.

#### 4. Key Operations

*   **User Credential Validation**: The endpoint rigorously validates the provided username and password against securely stored credentials using the Spring Security framework, including password hashing and comparison.
*   **User Data Retrieval**: It fetches comprehensive user details from the database required for authentication and token generation.
*   **JWT Generation**: Two types of JWTs are created:
    *   **Access Token**: A short-lived token for immediate authorization.
    *   **Refresh Token**: A long-lived token used to renew expired access tokens.
*   **Refresh Token Persistence**: The refresh token is securely stored in the database, tied to the user and a specific device, enabling robust session management and revocation capabilities.
*   **Secure Cookie Management**: Both access and refresh tokens are securely embedded in HTTP-only, secure, and SameSite cookies within the HTTP response, preventing client-side JavaScript access and enhancing protection against common web vulnerabilities.
*   **Standardized Response Formatting**: The successful authentication response is structured into a consistent JSON format for client consumption, indicating successful login and providing the access token's expiration.

#### 5. Dependencies

*   **Request/Response Entities (Data Models/DTOs)**:
    *   `LoginRequest`: Represents the incoming JSON payload (username, password, deviceId).

    *   **Logging Utilities**: (e.g., SLF4J, Logback) For capturing operational and error logs.

#### 6. Security Features

*   **Password Hashing**: User passwords are never stored or handled in plain text. They are securely hashed using `PasswordEncoder` before comparison, protecting against data breaches.
*   **JWT Digital Signing**: Both access and refresh tokens are digitally signed using a strong cryptographic key. This ensures the tokens' integrity (they haven't been tampered with) and authenticity (they were issued by a trusted source).
*   **HttpOnly Cookies**: The generated JWTs are stored in `HttpOnly` cookies. This prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the tokens, significantly mitigating the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   **Secure Cookies**: Cookies are marked as `Secure`, ensuring they are only transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections. This protects tokens from interception during transit (Man-in-the-Middle attacks).
*   **SameSite Cookies**: The `SameSite=Lax` attribute is applied to cookies. This helps mitigate Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by preventing the browser from sending cookies with cross-site requests.
*   **Device-Specific Refresh Tokens**: Refresh tokens are explicitly linked to a `deviceId`. This allows for more granular control over active sessions and enables targeted revocation (e.g., revoking tokens for a lost device).
*   **Refresh Token Storage Security**: Refresh tokens are stored in the database, implying potential additional layers of security like encryption at rest, further protecting long-lived credentials.
*   **Controlled Access Token Exposure**: The access token is not returned directly in the JSON response body to prevent its accidental exposure in client-side logs or insecure storage; it's exclusively managed via HttpOnly cookies.

#### 7. Error Handling

*   **Authentication Failures**: If the provided username or password is incorrect, or the user account is disabled/locked, `AuthenticationManager` will throw an `AuthenticationException`. This exception is caught by the API, and a `401 Unauthorized` or `400 Bad Request` HTTP status code is returned to the client, along with a descriptive error message in a standardized JSON format.
*   **Invalid Input**: Missing required parameters (e.g., username, password) or malformed JSON payloads will be detected by the framework's validation mechanisms. These typically result in a `400 Bad Request` status code with specific validation error details.
*   **Database Errors**: Issues occurring during database interactions (e.g., `UserRepository`, `RefreshTokenRepository` failures due to connection problems or schema issues) are caught and typically result in a `500 Internal Server Error` status code, indicating a server-side problem.
*   **Logging**: All errors (authentication failures, validation errors, internal server errors) are logged with sufficient detail (e.g., stack traces, relevant request parameters) using the configured logging framework (e.g., Logback, Log4j). This aids in debugging, monitoring, and security auditing.
*   **Consistent Error Response**: Errors are consistently communicated to the client via a JSON payload that typically includes a status code, a concise error message, and potentially an internal error code for client-side mapping.

#### 8. Performance Considerations

*   **Optimized Authentication Flow**: Leverages Spring Security's highly optimized `AuthenticationManager` and `PasswordEncoder` for efficient credential validation.
*   **Indexed Database Lookups**: `UserRepository.findByUsername` should be backed by an efficient index on the `username` column in the database to ensure rapid user retrieval.
*   **Efficient Token Generation**: JWT generation is a computationally efficient cryptographic process. The `JwtTokenProvider` is designed to quickly create signed tokens.
*   **Minimized Cookie Overhead**: The size of the JWTs is managed to keep HTTP header sizes minimal, reducing network overhead.
*   **Metrics and Monitoring**: (Implicit) For production environments, this endpoint is typically instrumented with metrics collection (e.g., via Micrometer/Prometheus) to monitor response times, error rates, and throughput, allowing for continuous performance analysis and optimization.

#### 9. Usage Pattern

*   **Typical Use Case**: This endpoint is the primary method for users to log in to the application. It is typically invoked from a login form or a similar authentication interface within a web application or mobile client.
*   **Prerequisites**:
    *   The user must have a registered account within the system.
    *   The client application must securely collect and transmit the user's username and password.
*   **Post-Authentication Flow**:
    *   Upon successful authentication, the client receives the `Set-Cookie` headers containing the `accessToken` and `refreshToken`.
    *   Browsers will automatically store these cookies and include them in subsequent requests to the same domain (or specified paths), providing seamless authorization for API calls requiring authentication.
    *   The `accessToken` is used for short-term authorization. Once it expires, the `refreshToken` can be used via a separate endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/auth/refresh`) to obtain a new `accessToken` without requiring the user to re-enter their credentials.

#### 10. Additional Notes

*   **Token Expiration Strategy**: The `accessToken` is designed to be short-lived (e.g., 15-60 minutes) for security reasons, limiting the window of exposure if intercepted. The `refreshToken` has a much longer lifespan (e.g., days, weeks, or months) to provide a better user experience by minimizing re-logins.
*   **Refresh Token Rotation (Potential)**: While not explicitly shown in the hierarchy, a common enhancement for refresh tokens is "rotation," where a new refresh token is issued with each refresh request, and the old one is immediately invalidated. This enhances security by limiting the lifespan of any single refresh token.
*   **CORS Configuration**: If the frontend application consuming this API resides on a different domain, proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers must be configured on the server to allow cross-origin requests and ensure that `Set-Cookie` headers are successfully processed by the client.
*   **Rate Limiting**: It is highly recommended to implement rate limiting on this endpoint to prevent brute-force attacks on user credentials. This typically involves limiting the number of login attempts from a single IP address or user account within a given time frame.
*   **Auditing**: Comprehensive auditing of both successful and failed login attempts should be in place for security monitoring and compliance purposes. This often involves logging detailed information about the attempt, including source IP, timestamp, and outcome.
