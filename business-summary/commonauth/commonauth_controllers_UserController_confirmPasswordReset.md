## API Endpoint Documentation: Session Token Generation

### 1. Endpoint Overview

*   **Endpoint Path**: `POST /api/v1/auth/generate-session-token`
*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Consumes**: `application/json` (Request Body)
*   **Produces**: `application/json` (Response Body)
*   **Purpose**: This endpoint is responsible for authenticating a user with provided credentials, generating secure session tokens (Access and Refresh Tokens), and establishing a user session by setting these tokens as HttpOnly cookies in the client's browser. It serves as the primary entry point for users to gain authenticated access to the system.
*   **Controller Method**: `AuthnController.generateSessionToken`
*   **Primary Function**: Handles user authentication, issues JWT-based access and refresh tokens, persists refresh tokens, and manages the secure delivery of these tokens via HTTP cookies.

### 2. Request and Response

*   **Request Type**:
    *   **Method**: `POST`
    *   **Headers**: `Content-Type: application/json`
    *   **Payload Structure (`AuthRequest`)**:
        ```json
        {
          "username": "user@example.com", // String: User's unique identifier (e.g., email or username)
          "password": "securepassword123" // String: User's plain-text password
        }
        ```
    *   **Input Parameters**: The endpoint expects a JSON payload containing the user's `username` and `password`. Both fields are mandatory and subject to validation.

*   **Response Type**:
    *   **Success Response (HTTP 200 OK)**:
        *   **Status Code**: `200 OK`
        *   **Headers**:
            *   `Content-Type: application/json`
            *   `Set-Cookie`: Two `Set-Cookie` headers will be present:
                *   `session_token=...; Path=/; Max-Age=3600; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax` (or `Strict` for stricter security)
                *   `refresh_token=...; Path=/auth/refresh; Max-Age=2592000; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax` (or `Strict`)
        *   **Payload Structure (`AuthResponse`)**:
            ```json
            {
              "message": "Authentication successful. Session tokens generated." // String: Confirmation message
            }
            ```
        *   **Cookies**:
            *   `session_token`: Contains the short-lived JWT Access Token. It is `HttpOnly` (inaccessible via client-side scripts), `Secure` (sent only over HTTPS), and has a `SameSite` policy.
            *   `refresh_token`: Contains the long-lived JWT Refresh Token. Similarly `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite`. This cookie is typically scoped to a specific path (e.g., `/auth/refresh`) for security.
    *   **Error Response (HTTP 4xx/5xx)**:
        *   **Status Code**: `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `500 Internal Server Error`, etc.
        *   **Headers**: `Content-Type: application/json`
        *   **Payload Structure**: Varies based on the error, but typically includes:
            ```json
            {
              "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:30:00Z",
              "status": 401,
              "error": "Unauthorized",
              "message": "Invalid username or password.",
              "path": "/api/v1/auth/generate-session-token"
            }
            ```

### 3. Call Hierarchy

The following outlines the sequential flow of operations executed when the `generateSessionToken` endpoint is invoked:

1.  **`AuthnController.generateSessionToken(AuthRequest authRequest)`**
    *   Primary entry point for the API endpoint.
    *   Receives the `AuthRequest` payload from the client.
    *   **Invokes**:
        *   `RequestValidationService.validateAuthRequest(authRequest)`:
            *   Performs initial validation on the `authRequest` object.
            *   **Invokes**:
                *   `ValidatorUtil.validateNotNullOrEmpty(field)`: Checks if essential fields (username, password) are present and not empty.
                *   `ValidatorUtil.validatePattern(field, pattern)`: Validates format (e.g., email regex for username, password strength).
            *   **Output**: Throws `ValidationException` if validation fails, otherwise proceeds.
        *   `AuthenticationService.authenticateUser(authRequest.getUsername(), authRequest.getPassword())`:
            *   Attempts to verify the user's credentials against the system's stored user data.
            *   **Invokes**:
                *   `UserRepository.findByUsername(username)`: Retrieves user details from the database based on the provided username.
                *   `PasswordEncoder.matches(rawPassword, encodedPassword)`: Compares the provided plain-text password with the stored hashed password using a secure hashing algorithm.
                *   `UserDetailsFactory.createUserDetails(user)`: Constructs a `UserDetails` object (a standard security abstraction) from the retrieved user data, containing necessary information for token generation (e.g., user ID, roles).
            *   **Output**: Returns `UserDetails` object on successful authentication, throws `BadCredentialsException` or `UsernameNotFoundException` on failure.
        *   `TokenService.generateAccessToken(userDetails)`:
            *   Generates a short-lived JSON Web Token (JWT) intended for resource access.
            *   **Invokes**:
                *   `JwtTokenProvider.createToken(claims, expiration)`: Encapsulates JWT creation logic.
                *   `Jwts.builder().setClaims().setExpiration().signWith()`: Utilizes a JWT library (e.g., JJWT) to build, set claims (e.g., user ID, roles, issuer), define expiration, and cryptographically sign the token.
            *   **Output**: `String` (Access Token JWT).
        *   `TokenService.generateRefreshToken(userDetails)`:
            *   Generates a long-lived JWT specifically for refreshing expired access tokens without re-authenticating credentials.
            *   **Invokes**: (Similar to access token generation)
                *   `JwtTokenProvider.createToken(claims, expiration)`:
                *   `Jwts.builder().setClaims().setExpiration().signWith()`:
            *   **Output**: `String` (Refresh Token JWT).
        *   `TokenService.storeRefreshToken(refreshToken, userDetails.getUserId())`:
            *   Persists the generated refresh token in a secure database to enable revocation and tracking.
            *   **Invokes**:
                *   `RefreshTokenRepository.save(new RefreshTokenEntity(...))`: Stores the refresh token along with associated user ID and expiration in a dedicated database table.
            *   **Output**: Stores the refresh token, proceeds on success.

        *   `CookieService.createRefreshTokenCookie(refreshToken)`:
            *   Creates an HTTP cookie containing the Refresh Token.
            *   **Invokes**:
                *   `CookieUtil.createCookie(name, value, maxAge, httpOnly, secure, sameSite)`: Similar cookie utility.
            *   **Output**: Configured `Cookie` object.
        *   `AuthResponse.build(accessToken, refreshToken)`:
            *   Constructs the final `AuthResponse` object. The actual tokens are primarily sent via cookies, but a success message confirms the operation.
            *   **Output**: `AuthResponse` object with a success message.

### 4. Key Operations

1.  **Request Validation**: Ensures the incoming `username` and `password` are present and adhere to predefined formats and constraints.
2.  **User Authentication**: Verifies the provided credentials against the system's user database, comparing the plain-text password with its hashed counterpart.
3.  **Access Token Generation**: Creates a short-lived JWT that proves the user's identity and grants access to protected resources.
4.  **Refresh Token Generation**: Creates a long-lived JWT used to obtain new access tokens once the current one expires, reducing the need for repeated password authentication.
5.  **Refresh Token Storage**: Persists the refresh token in the database, allowing for token revocation and ensuring a single valid refresh token per user session for better security.
6.  **Cookie Management**: Creates and configures two secure HTTP-only cookies (`session_token` for access token, `refresh_token` for refresh token) to be sent to the client, facilitating secure session management.

### 5. Dependencies

*   **Request/Response Entities**:
    *   `AuthRequest`: Data Transfer Object (DTO) for incoming authentication requests.
    *   `AuthResponse`: DTO for outgoing authentication responses.
    *   `UserDetails`: Security framework object representing an authenticated user's details.
    *   `RefreshTokenEntity`: Database entity representing a stored refresh token.
*   **Services**:
    *   `RequestValidationService`: Handles input validation logic.
    *   `AuthenticationService`: Manages user authentication and credential verification.
    *   `TokenService`: Orchestrates JWT generation and refresh token persistence.
    *   `CookieService`: Manages the creation and configuration of HTTP cookies.
*   **Repositories**:
    *   `UserRepository`: For fetching user details from the database.
    *   `RefreshTokenRepository`: For storing and retrieving refresh tokens in the database.
*   **Libraries/Frameworks**:
    *   **Spring Boot/Spring Web**: For building RESTful endpoints and managing application context.
    *   **Spring Security**: Provides authentication, authorization, and password encoding capabilities.
    *   **JWT Library (e.g., JJWT)**: For creating, signing, and parsing JSON Web Tokens.
    *   **Lombok**: (Assumed for DTOs) For reducing boilerplate code.
    *   **Logging Utility**: (e.g., SLF4J/Logback) For application logging.
    *   **Utility Classes**: `ValidatorUtil`, `CookieUtil`, `UserDetailsFactory`.

### 6. Security Features

*   **Credential Handling**: Passwords are never stored in plain text. `PasswordEncoder` ensures secure hashing and comparison.
*   **JWT Security**:
    *   **Signing**: JWTs (both access and refresh tokens) are cryptographically signed using a strong secret key, preventing tampering.
    *   **Expiration**: Access tokens have a short expiration (e.g., 1 hour), limiting the window of opportunity for misuse if intercepted. Refresh tokens have a longer expiration (e.g., 30 days).
    *   **Claims**: Tokens contain minimal necessary claims (e.g., user ID, roles) to reduce token size and potential exposure.
*   **Cookie Security**:
    *   **HttpOnly**: Cookies are set with the `HttpOnly` flag, preventing client-side JavaScript from accessing them, which mitigates XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.
    *   **Secure**: Cookies are set with the `Secure` flag, ensuring they are only sent over HTTPS connections, protecting against eavesdropping.
    *   **SameSite Policy**: Cookies are set with a `SameSite` attribute (e.g., `Lax` or `Strict`) to prevent CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks by restricting cookie transmission in cross-site requests.
*   **Refresh Token Management**:
    *   Refresh tokens are stored in a database, enabling server-side invalidation/revocation (e.g., on logout or security breach).
    *   Refresh tokens are typically single-use or have strict rotation policies to limit their lifespan if compromised.
*   **Input Validation**: Robust validation of username and password prevents injection attacks and ensures data integrity.
*   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: While not explicitly in the call hierarchy, it's assumed that appropriate CORS headers are configured at the API gateway or application level to allow specific origins to access this endpoint while blocking unauthorized ones.

### 7. Error Handling

*   **Validation Errors**:
    *   If `RequestValidationService` detects invalid input (e.g., missing fields, incorrect format), a `400 Bad Request` status with a descriptive error message is returned to the client.
*   **Authentication Errors**:
    *   If `AuthenticationService` fails to authenticate credentials (e.g., incorrect username/password), a `401 Unauthorized` status is returned. Specific messages like "Invalid username or password" are provided for user feedback.
*   **Internal Server Errors**:
    *   Any unexpected exceptions (e.g., database connection issues, token generation failures) are caught by a global exception handler (assumed). A `500 Internal Server Error` status is returned, and detailed error information is logged internally for debugging, while a generic message is shown to the client.
*   **Logging**: Errors and their stack traces are logged at appropriate levels (e.g., `ERROR` or `WARN`) for monitoring and debugging purposes, typically using a centralized logging system.
*   **Consistent Error Structure**: Error responses are typically structured consistently, including a timestamp, HTTP status, error type, and a user-friendly message.

### 8. Performance Considerations

*   **Efficient Database Operations**: User retrieval and refresh token storage operations (`UserRepository.findByUsername`, `RefreshTokenRepository.save`) are optimized for speed, often utilizing indexing on relevant columns (e.g., `username`).
*   **JWT Generation Efficiency**: JWT creation and signing are generally fast, involving cryptographic operations that are optimized in underlying libraries.
*   **Minimal Payload**: The response payload is kept minimal (just a success message) as the critical data (tokens) is delivered via secure cookies, reducing network overhead.
*   **Cookie Size**: Tokens are kept reasonably sized to minimize the overhead in subsequent requests where cookies are sent.
*   **Metrics Collection**: It's highly probable that this critical endpoint is monitored with metrics (e.g., response time, error rate, throughput) to ensure its performance and availability using tools like Prometheus or similar.

### 9. Usage Pattern

This endpoint is typically the **first API call** a client (e.g., a web application, mobile app) makes after a user provides their login credentials in a UI.

*   **Prerequisites**:
    *   The user must have an existing account in the system.
    *   The client application must be capable of sending POST requests with JSON payloads and handling `Set-Cookie` headers.
    *   The client must be able to gracefully handle various HTTP status codes (200, 400, 401, 500) and display appropriate messages to the user.
*   **Typical Flow**:
    1.  User enters username and password in a login form.
    2.  Client application sends a `POST` request to `/api/v1/auth/generate-session-token` with the credentials in the JSON body.
    3.  Upon a `200 OK` response, the browser automatically stores the `session_token` and `refresh_token` cookies.
    4.  Subsequent API calls to protected resources will automatically include the `session_token` cookie, allowing the backend to authenticate the user without requiring repeated credential submission.
    5.  When the `session_token` expires, the client (or a background process) can use the `refresh_token` (typically sent to a `/auth/refresh` endpoint) to obtain a new `session_token` without requiring the user to re-enter credentials.

### 10. Additional Notes

*   **Token Expiration**: Access tokens are deliberately short-lived to reduce the impact of token compromise. Refresh tokens are longer-lived but are subject to revocation.
*   **Client Responsibility**: The client (e.g., browser) is responsible for automatically handling the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` cookies. There's no need for client-side JavaScript to store or manage these tokens, which is a significant security advantage.
*   **Future Enhancements**: Consider adding multi-factor authentication (MFA) capabilities layered on top of this basic authentication flow for enhanced security.
*   **Rate Limiting**: While not explicitly detailed, it's highly recommended to implement rate limiting on this endpoint to prevent brute-force attacks. This would typically be handled at an API Gateway or with a dedicated rate-limiting library.
