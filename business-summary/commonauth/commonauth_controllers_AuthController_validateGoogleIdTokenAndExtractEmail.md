### API Endpoint Documentation: Internal Token Generation

This document describes the `/api/v1/auth/token` API endpoint, responsible for generating internal application access and refresh tokens following a successful external authentication flow.

---

### 1. Endpoint Overview

*   **Endpoint Path**: `/api/v1/auth/token`
*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Consumes**: `application/json`
*   **Produces**: `application/json`
*   **Purpose**: This endpoint facilitates the final step of an external authentication process. Upon receiving a successful authentication indicator (e.g., an authorization code or ID token) from an external identity provider, it validates this indicator and issues a new set of internal application tokens (a short-lived Access Token and a long-lived Refresh Token) to the client. This effectively establishes an authenticated session for the user within the application.
*   **Controller Method Name**: `AuthController.generateToken`
*   **Primary Function**: To validate external authentication credentials and generate secure, signed internal application tokens (JWTs) for session establishment.

### 2. Request and Response

**Request Type**:
The request payload is a JSON object containing the necessary details from the external authentication provider to validate the user's identity.

*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Headers**: `Content-Type: application/json`
*   **Payload Structure (Example)**:
    ```json
    {
      "authCode": "a_unique_authorization_code_from_external_provider",
      "provider": "google | github | okta | ...",
      "redirectUri": "https://your.app.com/callback"
    }
    ```
    *   `authCode` (string, required): The authorization code or similar identifier obtained from the external identity provider after the user successfully authenticated.
    *   `provider` (string, required): A string identifying the external identity provider (e.g., "google", "okta", "github"). Used to select the correct validation logic.
    *   `redirectUri` (string, optional): The URI where the external provider redirected the user after authentication. May be required for validation against certain OAuth/OIDC flows.

**Response Type**:
On successful token generation, the endpoint returns a JSON object containing the access token and its expiration details. Additionally, secure HTTP-only cookies are set for both the Access Token and Refresh Token, providing a robust session management mechanism.

*   **Success Response (Status: 200 OK)**:
    *   **Payload Structure (Example)**:
        ```json
        {
          "message": "Tokens generated successfully.",
          "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
          "expiresIn": 3600,
          "tokenType": "Bearer"
        }
        ```
        *   `message` (string): A confirmation message.
        *   `accessToken` (string): The generated JSON Web Token (JWT) used for subsequent authenticated API requests.
        *   `expiresIn` (number): The lifespan of the access token in seconds (e.g., 3600 for 1 hour).
        *   `tokenType` (string): Indicates the type of token, typically "Bearer".
    *   **Headers**:
        *   `Set-Cookie`: Two `Set-Cookie` headers will be present for the `accessToken` and `refreshToken`.
            *   `Auth-Access-Token=eyJ...; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Max-Age=3600`
            *   `Auth-Refresh-Token=eyJ...; Path=/api/v1/auth/refresh; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Max-Age=2592000` (e.g., 30 days)
                *   **Note**: The `Path` for the refresh token cookie is typically restricted to the refresh endpoint to prevent accidental exposure.

### 4. Key Operations

1.  **External Authentication Validation**: The system contacts the configured external identity provider (e.g., Google OAuth, Okta, ADFS) to verify the `authCode` provided in the request. This ensures that the user has genuinely authenticated with the external system and that the code has not been tampered with or replayed. This is a critical security and trust-establishment step.
2.  **JWT (Access Token) Generation**: A short-lived JSON Web Token (JWT) is created. This token contains user identity, roles, and expiration claims, and is cryptographically signed to prevent tampering. It will be used by the client for subsequent authenticated API calls.
3.  **Refresh Token Generation and Persistence**: A long-lived JWT, the refresh token, is generated. This token is designed to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to re-authenticate. It is then stored in a secure database to enable revocation (e.g., if a user logs out or an account is compromised).
4.  **Cookie Creation and Management**: Both the access and refresh tokens are packaged into secure HTTP-only cookies. This ensures that client-side JavaScript cannot directly access the tokens, mitigating XSS risks. Specific attributes like `Secure` (for HTTPS only) and `SameSite` (to prevent CSRF) are applied.
5.  **Metrics Collection**: Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as successful token generations are recorded, providing valuable data for monitoring the endpoint's health and usage.
6.  **Centralized Error Handling**: A consistent error handling mechanism ensures that any issues during the process (e.g., invalid `authCode`, database errors, token generation failures) are caught, logged, and translated into a standardized, client-friendly error response.

### 5. Dependencies

*   **Request/Response Entities (DTOs)**:
    *   `TokenRequestDto`: Represents the incoming JSON payload from the client.
    *   `TokenResponseDto`: Represents the outgoing JSON payload returned to the client.
*   **Services**:
    *   `AuthService`: Orchestrates the authentication and token generation flow.
    *   `ExternalAuthValidationService`: Handles communication and validation with external identity providers.
    *   `TokenGenerationService`: Manages the creation and signing of JWTs.
    *   `TokenStoreService`: Interacts with the database for refresh token persistence and management.
    *   `CookieService`: Utility for creating and configuring secure HTTP cookies.
    *   `MetricsService`: For recording operational metrics.
    *   `ErrorHandler`: Centralized error processing and logging.
*   **Libraries**:
    *   **JWT Library**: (e.g., JJWT, `java-jwt`) for token creation, signing, and parsing.
    *   **HTTP Client Library**: (e.g., Apache HttpClient, Spring WebClient) for `externalAuthValidationService` to communicate with external identity providers.
    *   **Spring Framework**: (Assumed, based on typical Java application architecture) Provides core capabilities for controllers, services, dependency injection, and security.
    *   **Logging Utility**: (e.g., SLF4J, Logback) for logging operations and errors.
*   **Database Entities/Tables**:
    *   `RefreshTokenEntity` (or similar): Represents a record in the database for storing valid refresh tokens, typically linked to a user ID.
*   **Frameworks/Utilities**:
    *   **Spring Security**: (Implicitly used) for managing security contexts, authentication filters (though this endpoint performs the *initial* token generation, its output is consumed by Spring Security later).
    *   **Jackson**: (Assumed) for JSON serialization/deserialization.

### 6. Security Features

*   **JWT Security**:
    *   **Signing**: Both Access and Refresh tokens are cryptographically signed using a strong secret key (HMAC) or a public/private key pair (RSA/ECC) to ensure their integrity and authenticity. Any alteration to the token payload will invalidate the signature.
    *   **Expiration**: Tokens are assigned strict expiration times (`expiresIn`) to limit their lifespan and reduce the impact of token compromise. Access tokens are short-lived, while refresh tokens are longer-lived but managed securely.
*   **Cookie Security**:
    *   **`HttpOnly`**: Tokens are stored in `HttpOnly` cookies, preventing client-side JavaScript from accessing them. This significantly mitigates Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks where malicious scripts could otherwise steal tokens.
    *   **`Secure`**: Cookies are marked `Secure`, ensuring they are only transmitted over HTTPS connections, protecting them from eavesdropping.
    *   **`SameSite`**: Cookies are configured with a `SameSite` policy (e.g., `Lax` or `Strict`). This helps prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by restricting when cookies are sent with cross-site requests.
    *   **Specific Paths**: Refresh token cookies are often scoped to a very specific path (e.g., `/api/v1/auth/refresh`) to limit their exposure and prevent them from being sent unnecessarily with other requests.
*   **Input Validation**: The `TokenRequestDto` undergoes validation to ensure all required parameters are present and conform to expected formats, preventing malformed requests.
*   **External Authentication Validation**: The crucial `externalAuthValidationService` ensures that the `authCode` is valid and comes from a legitimate external identity provider, preventing unauthorized token minting.
*   **Refresh Token Revocation**: By storing refresh tokens in a database, the system can revoke them at any time (e.g., on logout, password change, or security incident), immediately invalidating ongoing sessions.
*   **CORS Handling**: (Assumed) The application framework typically handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies to allow requests from specific frontend origins while blocking others, preventing unauthorized access.

### 7. Error Handling

Error handling for this endpoint is robust and centralized:

*   **Types of Errors Handled**:
    *   **Invalid Input**: Missing or malformed parameters in the `TokenRequestDto` (e.g., `authCode` missing, invalid `provider`).
    *   **External Authentication Failure**: The `authCode` is invalid, expired, or rejected by the external identity provider.
    *   **Token Generation Failure**: Issues during the cryptographic signing process or if required user claims cannot be retrieved.
    *   **Database Errors**: Problems saving the refresh token (e.g., connectivity issues, unique constraint violations).
    *   **Internal Server Errors**: Unexpected exceptions during processing.
*   **Mechanism**: Errors are caught by the `errorHandler` service, which transforms them into a consistent error response format.
*   **Logging**: All errors are logged with sufficient detail (e.g., stack traces, relevant request context) to facilitate debugging and monitoring. Sensitive information is masked.
*   **Error Response Structure**:
    *   **HTTP Status Codes**: Appropriate HTTP status codes are returned (e.g., `400 Bad Request` for invalid input, `401 Unauthorized` for authentication failures, `500 Internal Server Error` for system issues).
    *   **Payload (Example)**:
        ```json
        {
          "errorCode": "INVALID_AUTH_CODE",
          "message": "The provided authorization code is invalid or expired.",
          "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:30:00Z"
        }
        ```
        *   `errorCode` (string): A consistent, machine-readable error code.
        *   `message` (string): A human-readable description of the error.
        *   `timestamp` (string): When the error occurred.

### 8. Performance Considerations

*   **Efficient Token Generation**: JWT signing operations are generally fast. The underlying `jwtUtil` is expected to use optimized cryptographic algorithms.
*   **Minimal Database Operations**: The `tokenStoreService.saveRefreshToken` operation involves a single database write, designed to be performant. Indexing on `userId` and `refreshToken` (if used for lookups) is assumed for efficiency.
*   **Cookie Size Optimization**: The size of the tokens embedded in cookies is kept to a minimum necessary to reduce network overhead on every subsequent request.
*   **Metrics Collection**: The `metricsService` enables real-time monitoring of the endpoint's latency and throughput, allowing for quick identification of performance bottlenecks.
*   **External Service Latency**: The primary external dependency is the call to the `externalAuthValidationService`. This call's latency is dependent on the external identity provider's response time, which is outside the application's direct control. Caching external provider configurations or employing timeouts can mitigate its impact.

### 9. Usage Pattern

*   **Typical Use Case**: This endpoint is designed to be called by a client-side application (e.g., a Single Page Application, mobile app) immediately after a user has successfully authenticated with an external identity provider (e.g., via OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect flow).
*   **Flow**:
    1.  User initiates login via an external provider (e.g., "Sign in with Google").
    2.  User is redirected to the external provider's login page, authenticates, and grants necessary permissions.
    3.  The external provider redirects the user back to the application's `redirectUri` with an `authCode`.
    4.  The client application extracts this `authCode` and makes a `POST` request to `/api/v1/auth/token`, sending the `authCode`, `provider` name, and `redirectUri`.
    5.  The application processes the request, validates the `authCode`, generates tokens, sets secure cookies, and returns a success response.
    6.  The client application is now authenticated and can make subsequent API calls using the `accessToken` (either from the response body or implicitly from the cookie).
*   **Prerequisites**:
    *   The client application must have successfully obtained a valid `authCode` from a pre-configured and trusted external identity provider.
    *   The external identity provider must be properly configured within the application's `externalAuthValidationService`.
    *   The client must be capable of handling HTTP `Set-Cookie` headers and managing the lifecycle of the access and refresh tokens.

### 10. Additional Notes

*   **Scalability of Refresh Token Storage**: The current refresh token storage mechanism (database) is suitable for many applications. For extremely high-scale scenarios or those requiring rapid cache invalidation, a distributed cache like Redis might be considered as an alternative or augmentation for `tokenStoreService`.
*   **Token Refresh Mechanism**: While this endpoint generates the initial tokens, a separate endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/auth/refresh`) would typically be responsible for exchanging a valid refresh token for a new access token without re-authenticating the user.
*   **User Roles and Permissions**: The determination of `roles` for the JWT (`tokenGenerationService`) is crucial and implicitly depends on how the application maps external user identities to internal authorization schemes. This might involve a lookup in an internal user management system or pre-defined rules.
*   **Idempotency**: This endpoint is not strictly idempotent as each successful call will generate a new set of tokens and refresh token entry. However, if the `authCode` is a one-time-use code, subsequent calls with the same code will fail validation.
