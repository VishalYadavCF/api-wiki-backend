## API Endpoint Documentation: User Authentication (Login)

### 1. Endpoint Overview

*   **Endpoint Path**: `/api/v1/auth/login`
*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Consumes**: `application/json` (Expected request body format)
*   **Produces**: `application/json` (Expected response body format)
*   **Brief Description**: This endpoint facilitates user authentication by verifying provided credentials, generating secure authentication tokens (Access and Refresh Tokens), and issuing them to the client via HTTP-only cookies. It serves as the primary entry point for users to establish a secure session with the application.
*   **Controller Method Name**: `AuthController.authenticateUser`
*   **Primary Function**: Authenticate a user, generate JWTs (Access Token and Refresh Token), store the Refresh Token, and set secure HTTP-only cookies containing these tokens in the client's browser.

### 2. Request and Response

*   **Request Type**:
    *   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
    *   **Payload Structure**: `application/json`
        ```json
        {
          "username": "user.name",
          "password": "secure-password"
        }
        ```
    *   **Parameters**:
        *   `username` (String): The user's unique identifier (e.g., email or username).
        *   `password` (String): The user's plain-text password for authentication.
*   **Response Type**:
    *   **Success Response (200 OK)**:
        *   **Status Code**: `200 OK`
        *   **Payload Structure**: `application/json`
            ```json
            {
              "userId": "uuid-of-user",
              "username": "user.name",
              "roles": ["USER", "ADMIN"]
            }
            ```
            *(Note: The actual tokens are transmitted via HTTP-only cookies and are not directly part of the response body for enhanced security.)*
        *   **Headers**:
            *   `Set-Cookie`: Multiple `Set-Cookie` headers will be present, each for a different token (e.g., `accessToken`, `refreshToken`). These cookies are configured with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` attributes for robust security.
                *   Example: `Set-Cookie: accessToken=jwt_access_token_value; Path=/; Max-Age=3600; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax`
                *   Example: `Set-Cookie: refreshToken=jwt_refresh_token_value; Path=/; Max-Age=2592000; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax`
        *   **Cookies**:
            *   `accessToken`: Contains the short-lived JSON Web Token for authentication.
            *   `refreshToken`: Contains the long-lived JSON Web Token for refreshing expired access tokens.

### 4. Key Operations

1.  **Request Validation**: Ensures the `LoginRequest` contains valid and non-empty `username` and `password` fields.
2.  **User Retrieval**: Fetches the user's details from the database based on the provided username.
3.  **Credential Verification**: Securely compares the client-provided password with the hashed password stored in the database using a cryptographic password encoder (e.g., BCrypt).
4.  **Access Token Generation**: Upon successful password verification, a short-lived JSON Web Token (JWT) is generated. This token contains essential user information (e.g., user ID, roles) and is signed for integrity.
5.  **Refresh Token Generation**: A long-lived JWT is also generated. This token is primarily used to obtain a new access token once the current one expires, reducing the need for repeated login attempts.
6.  **Refresh Token Persistence**: The generated refresh token is securely stored in a database. This allows for revocation capabilities and helps track active user sessions.
7.  **Secure Cookie Creation**: Both the access and refresh tokens are wrapped into highly secure `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` cookies. These cookies are designed to prevent client-side script access, ensure transmission over HTTPS, and mitigate CSRF attacks.
8.  **HTTP Response Construction**: The final HTTP response includes the `Set-Cookie` headers for the newly generated tokens and a success payload containing basic user information.

### 5. Dependencies

*   **Request/Response Entities (DTOs)**:
    *   `LoginRequest`: Data Transfer Object (DTO) for incoming login credentials.
    *   `AuthResponse`: DTO for the outgoing successful authentication response body.
    *   `User`: Data model representing a user in the system.
    *   `RefreshTokenEntity`: Data model representing a stored refresh token.
*   **Services**:
    *   `AuthService`: Encapsulates authentication business logic.
    *   `UserService`: Handles user-related data retrieval.
    *   `TokenService`: Manages JWT generation and signing.
    *   `CookieService`: Utility for creating and configuring secure HTTP cookies.
*   **Repositories**:
    *   `UserRepository`: For database interactions related to user data.
    *   `RefreshTokenRepository`: For database interactions related to refresh token persistence.
*   **Libraries/Frameworks**:
    *   **Spring Boot/Spring Web**: Core framework for building RESTful APIs.
    *   **Spring Security**: For authentication context, password encoding (e.g., `BCryptPasswordEncoder`), and potentially session management.
    *   **JWT Library (e.g., JJWT)**: For creating, signing, and verifying JSON Web Tokens.
    *   **Validation Library (e.g., Jakarta Validation)**: For request payload validation.
    *   **Database ORM (e.g., Spring Data JPA, Hibernate)**: For interacting with the underlying database.
    *   **Logging Utility (e.g., SLF4J, Logback)**: For logging operational and error messages.

### 6. Security Features

*   **Credential Validation**: Uses `passwordEncoder.matches` for secure password comparison, ensuring that stored passwords are never in plaintext and are securely hashed.
*   **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**:
    *   **Signed Tokens**: Both Access and Refresh Tokens are cryptographically signed to ensure their integrity and authenticity, preventing tampering.
    *   **Expiration**: Tokens have predefined expiration times, limiting the window of opportunity for misuse if intercepted. Access tokens are short-lived for reduced exposure.
*   **Cookie Security**:
    *   **`HttpOnly`**: Prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookies, significantly mitigating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
    *   **`Secure`**: Ensures cookies are only sent over HTTPS connections, protecting them from interception during transit.
    *   **`SameSite=Lax`**: Provides protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by restricting when cookies are sent with cross-site requests. `Lax` is a balanced choice that allows top-level navigations while still offering significant protection.
*   **Refresh Token Management**: Refresh tokens are stored in the database, allowing for server-side revocation in case of compromise or user logout, enhancing session control.
*   **Input Validation**: Basic input validation on `username` and `password` (e.g., length, non-empty) at the API gateway or controller level helps prevent injection attacks and malformed requests.
*   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: While not directly part of the call hierarchy, a robust CORS configuration is typically in place for such endpoints, allowing only authorized origins to interact with the API, preventing unauthorized cross-origin requests.

### 7. Error Handling

*   **Invalid Credentials**: If the `username` is not found or the `password` does not match, the endpoint returns a `401 Unauthorized` status code. This generic response prevents user enumeration attacks.
*   **Bad Request / Validation Errors**: If the incoming `LoginRequest` payload is malformed or fails input validation (e.g., missing `username` or `password`), a `400 Bad Request` status code is returned, typically with a descriptive error message.
*   **Internal Server Errors**: Any unforeseen issues during processing (e.g., database connection issues, token generation failures) result in a `500 Internal Server Error`. These errors are typically logged on the server-side with full stack traces for debugging but returned to the client with a generic error message to avoid leaking sensitive information.
*   **Error Logging**: All errors are logged using a robust logging framework, providing sufficient context (e.g., timestamp, request details, exception messages) for monitoring and troubleshooting.
*   **Consistent Error Structure**: For client consumption, errors often follow a consistent JSON structure, such as:
    ```json
    {
      "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:30:00Z",
      "status": 401,
      "error": "Unauthorized",
      "message": "Invalid username or password"
    }
    ```

### 8. Performance Considerations

*   **Efficient Database Operations**: User retrieval and refresh token persistence are optimized using indexing on relevant columns (e.g., `username` in the `users` table) to ensure quick lookup times.
*   **Optimized Token Generation**: JWT generation libraries are typically highly optimized for cryptographic operations, ensuring minimal latency.
*   **Minimal Cookie Overhead**: While two cookies are set, their size is kept minimal (JWTs are compact), reducing network overhead on subsequent requests.
*   **Stateless Access Tokens**: Access tokens are stateless (self-contained), meaning the server doesn't need to perform a database lookup for every authenticated request, improving scalability.
*   **Metrics Collection**: The endpoint is instrumented to collect performance metrics (e.g., response time, error rate, throughput), enabling monitoring and proactive identification of bottlenecks.

### 9. Usage Pattern

This endpoint is typically the *first* API call a user makes after launching the application or attempting to access protected resources when they are not authenticated.

1.  **User Interface Interaction**: The user enters their `username` and `password` into a login form on the client-side application (e.g., web browser, mobile app).
2.  **Client-Side Request**: The client application sends a `POST` request to `/api/v1/auth/login` with the credentials in the request body.
3.  **Server-Side Processing**: The API authenticates the user, generates tokens, and sets secure cookies.
4.  **Client-Side Cookie Handling**: The client's browser or HTTP client automatically stores the `accessToken` and `refreshToken` cookies.
5.  **Subsequent Requests**: For all subsequent authenticated requests to protected API endpoints, the client automatically includes the `accessToken` cookie. The API then validates this token to grant access.
6.  **Token Refresh (Implicit)**: When the `accessToken` expires, the client (or a built-in mechanism) can typically use the `refreshToken` (either by sending it to a dedicated refresh endpoint or through an interceptor) to obtain a new `accessToken` without requiring the user to re-enter credentials.

### 10. Additional Notes

*   **Token Expiration Strategy**: The `accessToken` typically has a short expiry (e.g., 15 minutes to 1 hour) for enhanced security, while the `refreshToken` has a much longer expiry (e.g., 7 days to 30 days) to provide a better user experience.
*   **Logout Mechanism**: A separate logout endpoint would be required to explicitly invalidate the refresh token stored in the database and clear the client's cookies, effectively terminating the user's session.
*   **Rate Limiting**: To prevent brute-force attacks, it is highly recommended to implement rate limiting on this endpoint, allowing only a limited number of login attempts within a specific time window from a given IP address or username.
*   **Assumptions**: This documentation assumes the use of a standard JWT library and a password encoder for secure credential handling. The exact names of services, repositories, and DTOs might vary based on the specific framework and architectural choices.
