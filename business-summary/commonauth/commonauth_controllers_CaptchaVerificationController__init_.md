### API Endpoint Documentation: User Authentication & Token Issuance

This document provides a detailed overview of the `/auth/login` API endpoint, designed for user authentication and the subsequent issuance of secure access and refresh tokens.

---

### 1. Endpoint Overview

*   **Endpoint Path**: `/auth/login`
*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Consumes**: `application/json` (Expects user credentials in JSON format)
*   **Produces**: `application/json` (Returns authentication status and potentially user details)
*   **Controller Method**: `AuthnController.login`
*   **Primary Function**: This endpoint serves as the primary entry point for user authentication. It validates user-provided credentials, generates cryptographic tokens (JWTs), and securely sets these tokens as HTTP-only cookies in the client's browser, establishing a user session.

---

### 2. Request and Response

*   **Request Type (Input Parameters)**:
    *   The endpoint expects a JSON payload in the request body, typically containing:
        *   `username` (string): The user's unique identifier (e.g., email or username).
        *   `password` (string): The user's plain-text password.
    *   **Example Request Body**:
        ```json
        {
          "username": "user@example.com",
          "password": "mySecurePassword123"
        }
        ```
    *   **Underlying Data Model**: `LoginRequest` (or similar DTO/POJO).

*   **Response Type (Output Structure)**:
    *   **Success Response (HTTP 200 OK)**:
        *   **Status Code**: `200 OK`
        *   **Payload**: A JSON object (`LoginResponse`) confirming successful authentication. This might include non-sensitive user details (e.g., user ID, roles, display name) but *not* the tokens themselves (as they are delivered via cookies).
        *   **Headers**:
            *   `Set-Cookie`: Two `Set-Cookie` headers will be present: one for the `access_token` and another for the `refresh_token`. These cookies are configured with strong security attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite) to prevent client-side access and enhance security.
        *   **Example Success Response Body**:
            ```json
            {
              "message": "Authentication successful",
              "userId": "uuid-123-abc",
              "roles": ["USER"]
            }
            ```
            (Actual cookies are in headers, not body.)
    *   **Error Response (HTTP 4xx/5xx)**:
        *   **Status Code**:
            *   `400 Bad Request`: If the input payload is malformed or invalid (e.g., missing fields, incorrect format).
            *   `401 Unauthorized`: If the provided username and password do not match a valid user or are incorrect.
            *   Other 4xx/5xx status codes for unforeseen internal issues (e.g., database connectivity problems).
        *   **Payload**: A standardized JSON error object (`ErrorResponse`), typically including:
            *   `timestamp` (string): When the error occurred.
            *   `status` (integer): The HTTP status code.
            *   `error` (string): A brief description of the error (e.g., "Unauthorized", "Bad Request").
            *   `message` (string): A more specific error message for the client.
            *   `path` (string): The requested URI.
        *   **Example Error Response Body (401 Unauthorized)**:
            ```json
            {
              "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:30:00.000+00:00",
              "status": 401,
              "error": "Unauthorized",
              "message": "Invalid username or password.",
              "path": "/auth/login"
            }
            ```
        *   **Headers**: No `Set-Cookie` headers for token issuance on error.

### 3. Call Hierarchy

The `AuthnController.login` endpoint orchestrates a sequence of operations to process the authentication request. The flow is as follows:

1.  **`AuthnController.login(LoginRequest loginRequest)`**:
    *   **Input**: `LoginRequest` object containing `username` and `password`.
    *   **Initial Action**: Receives the incoming HTTP request.
    *   **Invokes**:
        *   **Request Validation**:
            *   Performs initial validation on the `loginRequest` payload (e.g., using Spring's `@Valid` annotation or a custom validator). This ensures that the username and password fields are present and meet basic format requirements.
            *   **Purpose**: Prevents processing of malformed requests early, improving efficiency and security.
        *   **`AuthenticationService.authenticate(username, password)`**:
            *   **Purpose**: Core logic for verifying user credentials.
            *   **Invokes**:
                *   `UserRepository.findByUsername(username)`:
                    *   **Purpose**: Retrieves the user's account details from the database based on the provided username.
                    *   **Input**: `username` (string).
                    *   **Output**: User details object (e.g., `UserDetails` or a custom `UserEntity`), or `null` if not found.
                *   `PasswordEncoder.matches(rawPassword, encodedPassword)`:
                    *   **Purpose**: Compares the plain-text password from the request with the securely hashed password retrieved from the database. This is a one-way hash comparison.
                    *   **Input**: `rawPassword` (string from request), `encodedPassword` (string from database).
                    *   **Output**: `boolean` (true if passwords match, false otherwise).
            *   **Outcome**: If authentication is successful, the `AuthenticationService` returns details about the authenticated user. If not, it throws an authentication-specific exception (e.g., `BadCredentialsException`).

    *   **Conditional Logic (Authentication Success Path)**:
        *   **If authentication is successful**:
            *   `JwtTokenService.generateAccessToken(userDetails)`:
                *   **Purpose**: Creates a short-lived JSON Web Token (JWT) used for immediate authorization to protected resources.
                *   **Invokes**: `JwtUtility.createToken(claims, secret, expiration)`: Handles the actual cryptographic signing and construction of the JWT.
                *   **Input**: `userDetails` (information about the authenticated user).
                *   **Output**: Signed access token (string).
            *   `JwtTokenService.generateRefreshToken(userDetails)`:
                *   **Purpose**: Creates a longer-lived JWT used to obtain new access tokens without requiring re-authentication.
                *   **Invokes**: `JwtUtility.createToken(claims, secret, expiration)`: Same utility as for access token, but with different claims/expiration.
                *   **Input**: `userDetails`.
                *   **Output**: Signed refresh token (string).
            *   `RefreshTokenRepository.save(refreshTokenEntity)`:
                *   **Purpose**: Persists the generated refresh token in the database. This allows for server-side revocation and better session management.
                *   **Input**: `refreshTokenEntity` (an entity representing the refresh token, potentially including user ID, expiration, and token value).
                *   **Output**: Saved `refreshTokenEntity`.
            *   `CookieService.createAuthCookie(accessToken, expiration)`:
                *   **Purpose**: Constructs a secure HTTP-only cookie for the access token.
                *   **Invokes**: `ResponseCookie.from("access_token", accessToken).httpOnly(true).secure(true).sameSite("Lax").maxAge(...)`: Builds the cookie with specified attributes.
                *   **Input**: `accessToken` (string), `expiration` (long).
                *   **Output**: `ResponseCookie` object.
            *   `CookieService.createRefreshCookie(refreshToken, expiration)`:
                *   **Purpose**: Constructs a secure HTTP-only cookie for the refresh token.
                *   **Invokes**: `ResponseCookie.from("refresh_token", refreshToken).httpOnly(true).secure(true).sameSite("Lax").maxAge(...)`: Builds the cookie.
                *   **Input**: `refreshToken` (string), `expiration` (long).
                *   **Output**: `ResponseCookie` object.
            *   **Returns**: `ResponseEntity.ok().header(SET_COOKIE, ...).header(SET_COOKIE, ...).body(LoginResponse)`: Sends a 200 OK response with the generated cookies in the `Set-Cookie` headers and a success payload in the body.

    *   **Conditional Logic (Authentication Failure Path)**:
        *   **If authentication fails (e.g., `BadCredentialsException` is thrown)**:
            *   `GlobalExceptionHandler.handleBadCredentialsException`:
                *   **Purpose**: Catches specific exceptions thrown during authentication and formats them into a standardized error response.
                *   **Invokes**: Logging utilities to record the error.

### 4. Key Operations

1.  **Request Validation**: Ensures the incoming `LoginRequest` payload is syntactically correct and contains all necessary fields before processing. This reduces error propagation and protects against malformed requests.
2.  **User Authentication**: The core security operation. It verifies the user's identity by comparing the provided password against the securely stored hashed password, confirming the user's legitimacy.
3.  **JWT (JSON Web Token) Generation**:
    *   **Access Token**: A short-lived, signed token used for direct authorization to protected resources. Its short lifespan enhances security by limiting exposure if compromised.
    *   **Refresh Token**: A longer-lived, signed token used to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to re-enter credentials. This improves user experience while maintaining security.
4.  **Refresh Token Persistence**: Refresh tokens are stored in the database. This allows for server-side revocation of tokens (e.g., if a user logs out, their refresh token can be invalidated), enhancing session control and security.
5.  **Secure Cookie Management**: Both access and refresh tokens are encapsulated within HTTP-only, Secure, and SameSite cookies.
    *   **HttpOnly**: Prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie, mitigating XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.
    *   **Secure**: Ensures the cookie is only sent over HTTPS connections, protecting against eavesdropping.
    *   **SameSite**: Mitigates CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks by restricting when cookies are sent with cross-site requests.
6.  **Error Mapping and Handling**: Catches specific authentication-related exceptions and translates them into appropriate HTTP status codes and standardized error messages for the client, providing clear feedback.

### 5. Dependencies

This endpoint relies on several components and libraries to perform its functions:

*   **Request/Response Entities (Data Models/DTOs)**:
    *   `LoginRequest`: For incoming login credentials.
    *   `LoginResponse`: For successful authentication details returned to the client.
    *   `ErrorResponse`: For standardized error messages.
    *   `UserDetails`: An internal representation of an authenticated user's details.
    *   `RefreshTokenEntity`: For storing refresh token information in the database.
*   **Services**:
    *   `AuthenticationService`: Encapsulates the core authentication logic.
    *   `JwtTokenService`: Responsible for generating and managing JWTs.
    *   `CookieService`: Handles the creation and configuration of secure HTTP cookies.
*   **Repositories**:
    *   `UserRepository`: For database interactions related to fetching user details.
    *   `RefreshTokenRepository`: For database interactions related to persisting refresh tokens.
*   **Libraries/Frameworks**:
    *   **Spring Web**: For handling HTTP requests, responses, and annotations (`@RestController`, `@PostMapping`, `@RequestBody`, `ResponseEntity`).
    *   **Spring Security**: Provides core security functionalities like `PasswordEncoder`, `AuthenticationManager` (if used), and general security context management.
    *   **JJWT (Java JWT)** or similar JWT library: For creating, signing, and verifying JWTs.
    *   **Project Lombok**: (Likely) Used for reducing boilerplate code in DTOs and entities (`@Data`, `@NoArgsConstructor`, `@AllArgsConstructor`).
*   **Utilities**:
    *   `JwtUtility`: A helper class for common JWT operations (e.g., token creation, parsing, validation).
    *   `PasswordEncoder`: Used for securely hashing and comparing passwords (e.g., BCryptPasswordEncoder).

---

### 6. Security Features

The `/auth/login` endpoint incorporates several robust security features to protect user credentials and tokens:

*   **Password Hashing**: User passwords are never stored or compared in plain text. `PasswordEncoder` is used to hash passwords (e.g., using BCrypt, Argon2, or SCrypt) before storage and to compare the provided password against the hash during authentication. This protects against data breaches.
*   **JWT Signing and Expiration**:
    *   All generated JWTs (access and refresh tokens) are cryptographically signed using a strong secret key, ensuring their integrity and authenticity.
    *   Tokens are given a defined expiration time, limiting the window of opportunity for attackers if a token is compromised. Access tokens are typically short-lived (e.g., 15-30 minutes), while refresh tokens are longer (e.g., days or weeks).
*   **Secure Cookie Attributes**:
    *   **`HttpOnly`**: Prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the token cookies. This significantly reduces the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks stealing session tokens.
    *   **`Secure`**: Ensures that cookies are only sent over encrypted HTTPS connections, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks from eavesdropping on sensitive token data.
    *   **`SameSite=Lax` (or `Strict`)**: Provides protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by restricting when cookies are sent with cross-site requests. `Lax` allows cookies to be sent with top-level navigations (e.g., clicking a link) but not with embedded resources, offering a good balance of security and usability.
*   **Input Validation**: Strict validation on the incoming `LoginRequest` payload helps prevent injection attacks and ensures that only properly formatted data is processed.
*   **Refresh Token Revocation**: By persisting refresh tokens in the database, the system gains the ability to explicitly revoke refresh tokens (e.g., when a user logs out, changes password, or an administrator detects suspicious activity), thereby terminating sessions prematurely.

---

### 7. Error Handling

Error handling for this endpoint is designed to provide clear, actionable feedback to the client while protecting sensitive internal details:

*   **Invalid Input (`400 Bad Request`)**:
    *   If the incoming `LoginRequest` payload is malformed (e.g., not valid JSON), missing required fields, or fails validation rules (e.g., username not an email format if required), a `400 Bad Request` status is returned.
    *   The `ErrorResponse` payload will clearly indicate the specific validation error(s).
*   **Authentication Failures (`401 Unauthorized`)**:
    *   If the provided username and password do not match any known user or are incorrect, an `AuthenticationException` (specifically `BadCredentialsException`) is thrown.
    *   A `GlobalExceptionHandler` (or similar centralized error handler) catches this exception and returns a `401 Unauthorized` status.
    *   The `ErrorResponse` will contain a generic message like "Invalid username or password" to prevent brute-force attacks from guessing valid usernames.
*   **Internal Server Errors (`500 Internal Server Error`)**:
    *   Any unhandled exceptions, such as database connectivity issues (`UserRepository`, `RefreshTokenRepository`), unexpected errors during JWT generation, or other server-side failures, will typically result in a `500 Internal Server Error`.
    *   While the `ErrorResponse` will still be returned, it will contain a more generic message to avoid exposing internal system details.
*   **Logging**: All errors, regardless of type, are logged internally with appropriate detail (stack traces, request context) to facilitate debugging and monitoring. This ensures that operational teams can quickly identify and resolve issues.
*   **Consistency**: A `GlobalExceptionHandler` ensures that all errors returned to the client adhere to a consistent `ErrorResponse` format, making error parsing predictable for client applications.

---

### 8. Performance Considerations

The design of this endpoint incorporates several considerations to ensure efficient performance:

*   **Optimized Database Operations**:
    *   `UserRepository.findByUsername` typically uses an indexed column for `username` (or email), ensuring fast lookups of user records.
    *   `RefreshTokenRepository.save` operations are usually quick, involving simple inserts or updates.
*   **Efficient Password Hashing**: While password hashing is computationally intensive by design (to deter brute-force attacks), modern `PasswordEncoder` implementations are optimized to balance security with performance, using algorithms that are fast enough for legitimate logins but slow for mass attacks.
*   **Fast JWT Generation**: JWT creation and signing are generally lightweight cryptographic operations, contributing minimal overhead to the request latency.
*   **Minimal Cookie Size**: The `access_token` and `refresh_token` cookies are designed to be compact, containing only essential claims (e.g., user ID, expiration, roles). This minimizes network overhead and improves client-side performance.
*   **Metrics Collection**: (Implicit, but common practice) The endpoint's execution time, success rate, and error rates are typically collected using metrics libraries (e.g., Micrometer, Prometheus client). This enables real-time monitoring and proactive identification of performance bottlenecks or issues.
*   **Short-lived Access Tokens**: By using short-lived access tokens, the server avoids frequent database lookups for every protected resource request. The client only needs to present the access token, which can be quickly validated by the server using the shared secret key, improving overall API performance for subsequent requests.

---

### 9. Usage Pattern

This endpoint is a foundational component of the application's authentication flow and is typically used in the following context:

*   **Primary Login Mechanism**: It's the standard API call made by a client application (e.g., web frontend, mobile app) when a user attempts to log in.
*   **Post-Credential Submission**: The endpoint is invoked immediately after a user submits their username and password through a login form.
*   **Session Establishment**: A successful call to this endpoint establishes the user's session by providing the necessary access and refresh tokens. The client application is expected to store these tokens securely (e.g., the browser automatically stores them in cookies).
*   **Prerequisites**:
    *   The user must have an existing account registered in the system.
    *   The provided `username` and `password` must match the credentials stored in the system for that user.
*   **Subsequent Usage**: Once authenticated via this endpoint, the client can use the `access_token` (automatically sent by the browser in subsequent requests as a cookie) to access other protected API endpoints. When the access token expires, the `refresh_token` can be used to obtain a new access token via a dedicated refresh endpoint.

---

### 10. Additional Notes

*   **Statelessness (for Access Tokens)**: The use of JWTs (access tokens) promotes a largely stateless architecture on the server side for authorization, as the necessary user information and expiration are self-contained within the token. This simplifies scaling and makes the service more resilient.
*   **Refresh Token Importance**: The refresh token mechanism is crucial for maintaining long-lived user sessions without exposing sensitive data for extended periods. It allows for short access token lifespans while providing a seamless user experience.
*   **CORS Configuration**: While not explicitly detailed in the call hierarchy, this endpoint typically requires careful CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration if the frontend application is hosted on a different domain or port. The server must be configured to allow requests from the client's origin to prevent browser security restrictions.
*   **Token Revocation Strategy**: While refresh tokens are persisted for revocation, consideration should be given to how quickly and reliably tokens can be revoked across all instances in a distributed environment, especially for security-critical events (e.g., password change, account compromise).
