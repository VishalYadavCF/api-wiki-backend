### API Endpoint Documentation: `/auth/generate-token`

This document describes the `/auth/generate-token` API endpoint, which is crucial for establishing and managing user sessions after successful primary authentication.

---

#### 1. Endpoint Overview

*   **Endpoint Path**: `/auth/generate-token`
*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Consumes**: `application/json` (expected input payload)
*   **Produces**: `application/json` (for response messages, though primary output is via cookies)
*   **Purpose**: This endpoint is responsible for generating secure authentication tokens (an access token and a refresh token) for an authenticated user and setting them as secure HTTP-only cookies in the client's browser. It facilitates subsequent secure API interactions.
*   **Controller Method**: `AuthController.generateTokens` (assumed)
*   **Primary Function**: Token generation, cookie management, and user session establishment.

#### 2. Request and Response

*   **Request Type**:
    *   **Method**: `POST`
    *   **Payload Structure**: A JSON object containing the user's identifying information.
        ```json
        {
          "userId": "uniqueUserIdentifier123",
          "email": "user@example.com"
        }
        ```
    *   **Parameters**:
        *   `userId` (String, required): The unique identifier for the user for whom tokens are being generated.
        *   `email` (String, required): The email address associated with the user, often used for claims within the token.

*   **Response Type**:
    *   **Success Response (200 OK)**:
        *   **Status Code**: `200 OK`
        *   **Payload**: A simple JSON object indicating success. The primary outcome is delivered via `Set-Cookie` headers.
            ```json
            {
              "message": "Tokens generated and cookies set successfully."
            }
            ```
        *   **Headers**: Includes `Set-Cookie` headers for both the access token and refresh token.
        *   **Cookies**:
            *   `accessToken`: A short-lived, HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax cookie containing the JWT access token.
            *   `refreshToken`: A long-lived, HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax cookie containing the JWT refresh token.

#### 3. Call Hierarchy

The following represents the internal method call flow when the `/auth/generate-token` endpoint is invoked:

*   **`AuthController.generateTokens(HttpServletResponse response, TokenGenerationRequest request)`**
    *   This is the entry point for the API call. It receives the request payload and the `HttpServletResponse` object.
    *   It delegates the core logic to the `AuthService`.
    *   **Invokes**: `AuthService.generateTokenAndSetCookies(response, request.getUserId(), request.getEmail())`
        *   **Role**: Orchestrates the entire token generation and cookie setting process.
        *   **Input**: `HttpServletResponse`, `userId` (String), `email` (String)
        *   **Operations**:
            *   **Invokes**: `SecurityService.createAccessToken(userId, email)`
                *   **Role**: Creates a short-lived JSON Web Token (JWT) intended for resource access.
                *   **Input**: `userId`, `email`
                *   **Output**: `String accessToken`
                *   **Details**: Internally uses `JwtUtil.generateToken` to construct the JWT with specified claims and expiration.
            *   **Invokes**: `SecurityService.createRefreshToken(userId, email)`
                *   **Role**: Creates a long-lived JWT intended for refreshing the access token when it expires.
                *   **Input**: `userId`, `email`
                *   **Output**: `String refreshToken`
                *   **Details**: Internally uses `JwtUtil.generateToken` to construct the JWT with specified claims and expiration.
            *   **Invokes**: `CookieUtil.addCookie(response, "accessToken", accessToken, ACCESS_TOKEN_MAX_AGE, true, true, "Lax")`
                *   **Role**: Adds the generated access token to the HTTP response as a secure cookie.
                *   **Input**: `HttpServletResponse`, cookie name, token value, max age, secure flag, httpOnly flag, SameSite policy.
            *   **Invokes**: `CookieUtil.addCookie(response, "refreshToken", refreshToken, REFRESH_TOKEN_MAX_AGE, true, true, "Lax")`
                *   **Role**: Adds the generated refresh token to the HTTP response as a secure cookie.
                *   **Input**: `HttpServletResponse`, cookie name, token value, max age, secure flag, httpOnly flag, SameSite policy.
            *   **Invokes**: `UserService.updateUserLastLogin(userId)`
                *   **Role**: Updates the `lastLogin` timestamp for the specified user in the database.
                *   **Input**: `userId`
                *   **Operations**:
                    *   **Invokes**: `UserRepository.findByUserId(userId)` (retrieves user data)
                    *   **Invokes**: `UserRepository.save(user)` (persists updated user data)
            *   **Invokes**: `LogService.logEvent("TokenGenerationSuccess", userId, email)`
                *   **Role**: Records a successful token generation event for auditing and monitoring purposes.
                *   **Input**: Event type, `userId`, `email`

#### 4. Key Operations

1.  **Request Parsing and Validation**: The incoming request body (`userId`, `email`) is parsed and implicitly validated to ensure it contains necessary and correctly formatted data.
2.  **Access Token Creation**: A new JSON Web Token (JWT) is generated. This token is typically short-lived and used for authenticating subsequent requests to protected resources. It contains claims about the user (e.g., `userId`, `email`).
3.  **Refresh Token Creation**: Another JWT is generated, often with a longer lifespan than the access token. Its primary purpose is to obtain new access tokens once the current one expires, without requiring the user to re-authenticate with their credentials.
4.  **Cookie Management**: Both generated tokens are securely packaged into HTTP-only cookies. These cookies are then added to the HTTP response, instructing the client's browser to store them.
5.  **User Last Login Update**: The system updates the `lastLogin` timestamp in the user's database record. This is useful for tracking user activity and for security policies.
6.  **Event Logging**: A detailed log entry is created upon successful token generation, providing an audit trail for security and operational monitoring.

#### 5. Dependencies

*   **Request/Response Entities**:
    *   `TokenGenerationRequest` (DTO for input payload).
    *   `User` (Data model/entity for user information, used by `UserService` and `UserRepository`).
*   **Services**:
    *   `AuthService`: Orchestrates the token generation and cookie setting.
    *   `SecurityService`: Handles the core logic of creating JWTs (access and refresh tokens).
    *   `UserService`: Manages user-related operations, specifically updating the `lastLogin` timestamp.
    *   `LogService`: Provides logging capabilities for events and operations.
*   **Libraries/Utilities**:
    *   `JwtUtil`: A utility class/library responsible for generating and possibly validating JWTs.
    *   `CookieUtil`: A utility class/library for adding and configuring HTTP cookies securely.
    *   `HttpServletResponse`: Standard Java EE servlet API for handling HTTP responses.
    *   Spring Framework (or similar web framework): Provides annotations and infrastructure for controller and service components.
*   **Database Entities/Tables**:
    *   `User` table/collection: Stores user profiles and is updated with the `lastLogin` timestamp.
*   **Security Libraries**: Potentially Spring Security or a similar framework for overall security context and potentially JWT handling.

#### 6. Security Features

*   **JWT Security**:
    *   **Signing**: Both access and refresh tokens are JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are digitally signed to ensure their integrity and authenticity. This prevents tampering and verifies the issuer.
    *   **Expiration**: Tokens are configured with specific expiration times (`ACCESS_TOKEN_MAX_AGE`, `REFRESH_TOKEN_MAX_AGE`), limiting their validity and reducing the window for abuse if compromised.
*   **Cookie Security**:
    *   **`HttpOnly`**: Cookies are marked as `HttpOnly`, preventing client-side JavaScript from accessing them. This significantly mitigates Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks where an attacker might try to steal cookies.
    *   **`Secure`**: Cookies are marked as `Secure`, ensuring they are only sent over HTTPS (encrypted HTTP connections). This prevents eavesdropping and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
    *   **`SameSite=Lax`**: The `SameSite` attribute is set to `Lax`, which helps mitigate Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by restricting when cookies are sent with cross-site requests.
*   **HTTPS Enforcement**: The `Secure` flag on cookies strongly implies that the entire API should be served over HTTPS to protect data in transit.
*   **Input Validation**: While not explicitly detailed in the hierarchy, it is a critical underlying security practice to validate `userId` and `email` inputs to prevent injection attacks or malformed requests.

#### 7. Error Handling

Error handling within this endpoint is designed to provide clear feedback and ensure system stability:

*   **Types of Errors Handled**:
    *   **Bad Request/Invalid Input**: If the `userId` or `email` are missing, malformed, or do not conform to expected patterns (e.g., if a pre-existing user check fails).
    *   **User Not Found**: If the `UserService.updateUserLastLogin` method cannot locate the user specified by `userId` in the database.
    *   **Internal Server Errors**: Unexpected issues during token generation (e.g., cryptographic failures, issues with JWT library), database errors during user update, or other unhandled exceptions.
*   **Error Logging**: Errors are typically logged using the `LogService` (or similar logging framework) to capture detailed information for debugging and operational monitoring. This includes stack traces and relevant context.
*   **Error Response Structure**:
    *   For client-side errors (e.g., invalid input), an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., `400 Bad Request`) is returned, along with a JSON payload detailing the error.
        ```json
        {
          "status": 400,
          "error": "Bad Request",
          "message": "User ID or email is invalid."
        }
        ```
    *   For internal server errors, an `500 Internal Server Error` status code is returned, possibly with a generic error message to avoid exposing sensitive internal details, while detailed errors are logged server-side.

#### 8. Performance Considerations

*   **Efficient Token Generation**: JWT generation is a computationally efficient cryptographic operation, designed for high-throughput authentication.
*   **Minimal Database Operations**: The endpoint performs a single database lookup (`findByUserId`) followed by a single update (`save`) for the `lastLogin` timestamp. This is a quick and non-blocking operation.
*   **Cookie Size**: Cookies containing JWTs are typically small, minimizing network overhead per request.
*   **Stateless Tokens**: The use of JWTs makes the authentication process largely stateless on the server side, which significantly aids in scalability and reduces server load compared to traditional session management.
*   **Logging Overhead**: The `LogService.logEvent` call is designed to be non-blocking or asynchronous to minimize impact on the critical path.

#### 9. Usage Pattern

This endpoint is typically called immediately **after a user has successfully authenticated** with their primary credentials (e.g., username/password, social login, OTP).

*   **Context**: It's part of the login flow, where the user's identity has been verified through a preceding step (e.g., a separate `/auth/login` endpoint that validates credentials).
*   **Purpose**: Its role is to establish a secure, session-like state for the client by providing them with the necessary tokens (via cookies) to make subsequent authorized requests to the application's protected APIs.
*   **Prerequisites**:
    1.  The user's identity must have been successfully verified by an upstream authentication mechanism.
    2.  The `userId` and `email` for the authenticated user must be available to be passed to this endpoint.

#### 10. Additional Notes

*   **Token Refresh Mechanism**: While this endpoint *generates* the refresh token, a separate endpoint (e.g., `/auth/refresh-token`) would typically be used by the client to exchange an expired access token for a new one using the refresh token, without requiring full re-authentication.
*   **Token Revocation**: This endpoint does not inherently support token revocation. For more advanced security, especially for refresh tokens, a mechanism to revoke tokens (e.g., by blacklisting them or managing them in a database) might be necessary, particularly for logout functionality or compromised accounts.
*   **Scalability**: By utilizing stateless JWTs and secure cookie mechanisms, this endpoint contributes to a highly scalable authentication architecture, as the server does not need to maintain session state for each user.
*   **Assumptions**: This documentation assumes the presence of a preceding authentication step that verifies the user and provides the `userId` and `email` to this endpoint. It also assumes `JwtUtil` and `CookieUtil` handle their respective responsibilities robustly.
