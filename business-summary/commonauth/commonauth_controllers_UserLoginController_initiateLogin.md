#### 3. Call Hierarchy

The following outlines the sequential flow of operations and method calls when the `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint is invoked:

1.  **`AuthRestController.authenticateUser(LoginRequestDTO request, HttpServletResponse response)`**
    *   **Role:** The main entry point for the authentication request. It receives the user's credentials, orchestrates the authentication process, and manages the response, including setting cookies.
    *   **Operations:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Invokes `ValidationService.validateLoginRequest(request)`.
            *   **Purpose:** Ensures that the incoming `LoginRequestDTO` adheres to defined constraints (e.g., username and password are not empty, conform to format requirements). If validation fails, an appropriate error is returned to the client immediately.
        *   **Authentication Delegation:** Calls `AuthService.authenticate(request.getUsername(), request.getPassword())`.
            *   **Purpose:** Delegates the core authentication logic to the `AuthService`.
            *   **Output:** Returns an `AuthTokensDTO` containing the generated `accessToken` and `refreshToken`.
        *   **Cookie Generation & Setting:**
            *   Retrieves the `accessToken` and `refreshToken` from the `AuthTokensDTO`.
            *   Calls `CookieService.createAccessTokenCookie(accessToken)` to generate the secure Access Token cookie.
            *   Calls `CookieService.createRefreshTokenCookie(refreshToken)` to generate the secure Refresh Token cookie.
            *   Adds both generated cookies to the `HttpServletResponse` object using `response.addCookie()`. This sends the cookies to the client's browser.
        *   **Response Construction:** Prepares the `ResponseEntity<AuthResponseDTO>` containing success status, message, and basic user details.
        *   **Return:** Returns the `ResponseEntity` to the client.

2.  **`AuthService.authenticate(String username, String password)`**
    *   **Role:** Handles the core business logic for user authentication, including credential verification, user retrieval, and token generation.
    *   **Operations:**
        *   **User Retrieval:** Calls `UserService.findByUsername(username)`.
            *   **Purpose:** Fetches the user record from the database based on the provided username.
            *   **Outcome:** If the user is not found, throws an `InvalidCredentialsException`.
        *   **Password Verification:** Performs a secure comparison of the provided plaintext `password` against the hashed password stored in the retrieved user's record (using a password encoder like `BCryptPasswordEncoder`).
            *   **Outcome:** If the passwords do not match, throws an `InvalidCredentialsException`.
        *   **Access Token Generation:** Calls `JwtService.generateAccessToken(user.getId(), user.getRoles())`.
            *   **Purpose:** Creates a short-lived JSON Web Token (JWT) containing the user's ID and roles, signed with a secret key. This token is used for subsequent authorized API calls.
        *   **Refresh Token Generation:** Calls `JwtService.generateRefreshToken(user.getId())`.
            *   **Purpose:** Creates a long-lived JWT primarily used to obtain new access tokens without re-authenticating with credentials.
        *   **Refresh Token Persistence:** Calls `RefreshTokenRepository.save(refreshTokenEntity)`.
            *   **Purpose:** Stores the generated refresh token in the database, allowing for its revocation and management.
        *   **Return:** Returns an `AuthTokensDTO` containing both the generated `accessToken` and `refreshToken`.

3.  **`UserService.findByUsername(String username)`**
    *   **Role:** Provides an abstraction for user-related data access.
    *   **Operations:**
        *   **Database Interaction:** Calls `UserRepository.findByUsername(username)`.
            *   **Purpose:** Directly queries the underlying database (e.g., using JPA or JDBC) to find a user record matching the given username.
            *   **Output:** Returns a `UserEntity` object if found, otherwise `null` or an `Optional.empty()`.

4.  **`JwtService.generateAccessToken(String userId, Set<String> roles)`**
    *   **Role:** Responsible for creating the Access Token.
    *   **Operations:** Constructs a JWT payload (claims) including `userId` and `roles`, sets an appropriate expiration time (short-lived), and digitally signs the token using a configured secret key.

5.  **`JwtService.generateRefreshToken(String userId)`**
    *   **Role:** Responsible for creating the Refresh Token.
    *   **Operations:** Constructs a JWT payload (claims) including `userId`, sets a longer expiration time, and digitally signs the token.

6.  **`CookieService.createAccessTokenCookie(String accessToken)`**
    *   **Role:** Encapsulates the logic for creating the secure `HttpServletResponse` cookie for the access token.
    *   **Operations:** Creates a new `Cookie` object, sets its name (e.g., "accessToken"), value (`accessToken`), maximum age, `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` attributes.

7.  **`CookieService.createRefreshTokenCookie(String refreshToken)`**
    *   **Role:** Encapsulates the logic for creating the secure `HttpServletResponse` cookie for the refresh token.
    *   **Operations:** Creates a new `Cookie` object, sets its name (e.g., "refreshToken"), value (`refreshToken`), maximum age, `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` attributes.

#### 4. Key Operations

The primary operations performed by this endpoint include:

*   **Request Validation:** Ensures all required input fields are present and correctly formatted, preventing malformed requests from proceeding.
*   **User Authentication:** Verifies the user's identity by comparing provided credentials against stored records, including secure password hashing.
*   **Access Token Generation:** Creates a short-lived JSON Web Token (JWT) containing user identity and authorization details, crucial for subsequent API calls.
*   **Refresh Token Generation & Persistence:** Generates a long-lived JWT used to obtain new access tokens without re-authenticating, and securely stores it in the database for tracking and revocation purposes.
*   **Secure Cookie Management:** Sets both the Access and Refresh Tokens as HTTP-only, secure, and SameSite-protected cookies in the client's browser, preventing client-side script access and mitigating CSRF attacks.

---

#### 5. Dependencies

This endpoint relies on several components and services:

*   **Request/Response Entities:**
    *   `LoginRequestDTO`: Data Transfer Object for incoming login credentials.
    *   `AuthTokensDTO`: DTO for encapsulating generated access and refresh tokens internally.
    *   `AuthResponseDTO`: DTO for the outgoing successful authentication response.
    *   `UserEntity`: Represents the user data model retrieved from the database.
    *   `RefreshTokenEntity`: Represents the refresh token data model stored in the database.
*   **Services:**
    *   `ValidationService`: For input payload validation.
    *   `AuthService`: Encapsulates core authentication logic.
    *   `UserService`: Manages user-related operations (e.g., finding by username).
    *   `JwtService`: Responsible for JWT generation and signing.
    *   `CookieService`: Handles the creation and configuration of secure cookies.
*   **Repositories:**
    *   `UserRepository`: Data access layer for user entities (e.g., Spring Data JPA repository).
    *   `RefreshTokenRepository`: Data access layer for refresh token entities.
*   **Database:**
    *   `users` table: Stores user credentials and profile information.
    *   `refresh_tokens` table: Stores details of issued refresh tokens.
*   **Frameworks/Libraries:**

#### 6. Security Features

The endpoint incorporates robust security measures to protect user data and maintain session integrity:

*   **Input Validation:** Prevents common attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) by validating and sanitizing all incoming request parameters.
*   **Password Security:** While not explicitly detailed in the hierarchy, `AuthService` is expected to use a secure password hashing mechanism (e.g., BCrypt, Argon2) for storing and verifying user passwords, never storing them in plaintext.
*   **JWT Security:**
    *   **Signing:** Both Access and Refresh Tokens are digitally signed using a strong secret key, ensuring their authenticity and integrity (i.e., they haven't been tampered with).
    *   **Expiration:** Access Tokens are short-lived (e.g., 15-30 minutes) to minimize the impact of token compromise. Refresh Tokens are longer-lived but managed carefully.
*   **Cookie Security:**
    *   **`HttpOnly`:** Cookies are marked as `HttpOnly`, preventing client-side JavaScript from accessing them, which mitigates XSS attacks.
    *   **`Secure`:** Cookies are marked as `Secure`, ensuring they are only sent over HTTPS connections, protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **`SameSite=Lax`:** Cookies are configured with `SameSite=Lax` to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by restricting when cookies are sent with cross-site requests.
*   **Refresh Token Management:** Refresh tokens are persisted in the database, allowing for server-side revocation if necessary (e.g., upon logout, password change, or security compromise).

---

#### 7. Error Handling

The endpoint is designed to gracefully handle various error scenarios:

*   **Input Validation Errors:**
    *   **Trigger:** If `ValidationService.validateLoginRequest` detects missing or malformed input.
    *   **Response:** An HTTP `400 Bad Request` status code is returned with a JSON payload detailing the specific validation failures.
*   **Authentication Failures:**
    *   **Trigger:** If `AuthService.authenticate` fails to find a user or verifies incorrect credentials (e.g., username not found, password mismatch).
    *   **Response:** An `InvalidCredentialsException` is thrown internally, which is typically caught by a global exception handler and translated into an HTTP `401 Unauthorized` status code with a general "Invalid credentials" message to prevent username enumeration.
*   **Database Errors:**
    *   **Trigger:** Issues during database operations (e.g., `UserRepository.findByUsername`, `RefreshTokenRepository.save`) such as connection errors, data corruption, or constraint violations.
    *   **Response:** These errors are typically caught by higher-level exception handlers (e.g., Spring's default error handling or a custom global handler) and result in an HTTP `500 Internal Server Error` with a generic message to the client, while detailed error information is logged internally for debugging.
*   **Logging:** All errors are logged using a logging utility (e.g., SLF4J/Logback) with appropriate log levels (e.g., `WARN` for client errors, `ERROR` for server errors) to facilitate monitoring and troubleshooting.

---

#### 8. Performance Considerations

The endpoint's design includes considerations for performance:

*   **Efficient Database Operations:** `UserService.findByUsername` and `RefreshTokenRepository.save` are expected to leverage indexed database columns for `username` and `userId` respectively, ensuring quick lookups and writes.
*   **Fast Token Generation:** JWT generation by `JwtService` is a computationally lightweight operation, typically executed in milliseconds.
*   **Minimal Cookie Overhead:** Cookies are designed to be concise to minimize network overhead on subsequent requests.
*   **Metrics Collection:** It's assumed that the underlying framework (Spring Boot Actuator) or custom instrumentation is in place to collect metrics (e.g., request latency, success/error rates) for monitoring the endpoint's performance in real-time.
*   **Optimized Validation:** Input validation is performed early in the request lifecycle to quickly reject invalid requests without unnecessary processing.

---

#### 9. Usage Pattern

This endpoint is typically the **first point of interaction for a client (e.g., a web browser or mobile application) that needs to establish a secure, authenticated session** with the API.

*   **Context:** Used when a user needs to log in to the application.
*   **Flow:**
    1.  The client presents the user interface for login.
    2.  The user enters their username and password.
    3.  The client sends a `POST` request to `/api/v1/auth/login` with the `LoginRequestDTO` in the request body.
    4.  If successful, the API responds with a `200 OK` status, includes `Set-Cookie` headers for `accessToken` and `refreshToken`, and a JSON body with basic user info.
    5.  The client's browser automatically stores these secure cookies.
    6.  For subsequent API calls requiring authentication, the browser automatically sends the `accessToken` cookie (and later the `refreshToken` cookie for token renewal) to the server.
*   **Prerequisites:** The user must have a registered account with valid credentials in the system.

---

#### 10. Additional Notes

*   **Token Refresh Mechanism:** While this endpoint issues both tokens, there should be a separate endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/auth/refresh`) for refreshing the `accessToken` using the `refreshToken` when the access token expires. This endpoint would rely on the `refreshToken` cookie for authentication.
*   **Password Encoding:** It is assumed that the `UserService` or `AuthService` handles the secure encoding/hashing of passwords before storing them and uses a compatible decoder during authentication.
*   **Stateless Access Tokens:** The Access Token is typically stateless (does not require server-side storage after generation), relying on its signature for validation. This contributes to scalability.
*   **Refresh Token Revocation:** The persistence of refresh tokens in the database allows the server to invalidate a specific refresh token, which is crucial for security events like account compromise or explicit logout.
