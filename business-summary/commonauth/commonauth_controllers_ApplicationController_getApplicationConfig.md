## API Endpoint Documentation: User Login & Session Establishment

This document describes the `/auth/login` API endpoint, responsible for authenticating users, generating a secure session token (JWT), and establishing a secure session cookie.

---

### 1. Endpoint Overview

*   **Endpoint Path**: `/auth/login`
*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Consumes**: `application/json` (for the login request payload)
*   **Produces**: `application/json` (for the authentication result), and sets an `HttpOnly`, `Secure` cookie.
*   **Brief Description**: This endpoint handles user authentication by validating provided credentials. Upon successful authentication, it generates a JSON Web Token (JWT) that serves as a session token and issues it to the client via a secure HTTP-only cookie. This token is subsequently used by the client for accessing protected resources.
*   **Controller Method Name**: `AuthnController.authenticate`
*   **Primary Function**: User credential verification, JWT token generation, and secure session cookie issuance.

### 2. Request and Response

*   **Request Type**:
    *   **Payload**: A JSON object containing user credentials.
    *   **Example Payload**:
        ```json
        {
          "username": "user.example@domain.com",
          "password": "SecurePassword123!"
        }
        ```
    *   **Parameters**:
        *   `username` (string, required): The user's registered username or email address.
        *   `password` (string, required): The user's plain-text password.
*   **Response Type**:
    *   **Success Response (200 OK)**:
        *   **Status Code**: `200 OK`
        *   **Payload**: A JSON object confirming successful authentication. While the JWT is delivered via cookie, the body might contain basic user info or a success message.
            ```json
            {
              "message": "Authentication successful",
              "userId": "usr_1a2b3c4d",
              "username": "user.example@domain.com"
            }
            ```
        *   **Headers**:
            *   `Set-Cookie`: Contains the `auth_token` cookie. This cookie holds the JWT and is configured with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Lax` attributes.
                *   Example: `Set-Cookie: auth_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1Ni...; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Max-Age=3600`
        *   **Cookies**:
            *   `auth_token`: An `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Lax` cookie containing the signed JWT. This cookie is automatically managed by the browser and sent with subsequent requests to the same domain.
    *   **Error Responses**: (See "Error Handling" section for details)
        *   `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input format (e.g., missing username/password).
        *   `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid credentials (e.g., incorrect username or password).

### 3. Call Hierarchy

The following outlines the sequential flow of method calls and operations within the `AuthnController.authenticate` endpoint:

1.  **`AuthnController.authenticate(LoginRequest loginRequest)`**
    *   **Role**: The entry point for the API call. Receives the `LoginRequest` payload from the client.
    *   Performs initial validation on the `loginRequest` object (e.g., checks for `null` or empty fields).
    *   Delegates the core authentication and token generation logic to the `AuthenticationService`.
    *   Upon successful completion, constructs the `ResponseEntity` including setting the `Set-Cookie` header with the generated authentication cookie.
    *   Returns the `AuthenticationResult` object as the response body.

    *Invokes:* `AuthenticationService.authenticate()`

    `-> AuthenticationService.authenticate(username, password)`
    *   **Role**: Orchestrates the entire authentication process. Responsible for retrieving user details, validating credentials, generating the JWT, and preparing the authentication cookie.
    *   **Input**: `username` (string), `password` (string).
    *   **Output**: An `AuthenticationResult` object containing user information and the generated JWT (implicitly, as it's passed to `CookieService`).

    *Invokes:* `UserService.findByUsername()`, `PasswordEncoder.matches()`, `JwtTokenProvider.generateToken()`, `CookieService.createAuthCookie()`

    `-> UserService.findByUsername(username)`
    *   **Role**: Handles business logic related to user retrieval.
    *   **Input**: `username` (string).
    *   **Output**: User details (e.g., `UserDetails` object or custom `User` entity).

    *Invokes:* `UserRepository.findByUsername()`

    `-> UserRepository.findByUsername(username)`
    *   **Role**: Interacts directly with the database to fetch user records.
    *   **Input**: `username` (string).
    *   **Output**: The `User` entity corresponding to the provided username. If not found, a specific exception is thrown.

    `-> PasswordEncoder.matches(rawPassword, encodedPassword)`
    *   **Role**: A utility method (typically from a security framework) used to securely compare the client-provided raw password with the hashed password retrieved from the database.
    *   **Input**: `rawPassword` (string), `encodedPassword` (string).
    *   **Output**: `boolean` (true if passwords match, false otherwise).

    `-> JwtTokenProvider.generateToken(userDetails)`
    *   **Role**: Responsible for creating and signing the JSON Web Token.
    *   **Input**: `userDetails` (object containing user ID, roles, etc.).
    *   **Output**: A signed JWT string.

    *Invokes:* `JWT.create().withSubject(...).sign(Algorithm)` (Internal JWT library method)
    *   **Role**: Constructs the JWT header and payload, and signs the token using a configured algorithm and secret key.

    `-> CookieService.createAuthCookie(jwtToken)`
    *   **Role**: Constructs a secure HTTP cookie designed to carry the JWT.
    *   **Input**: `jwtToken` (string).
    *   **Output**: An `HttpCookie` object (or equivalent framework-specific cookie representation).

    *Invokes:* `new HttpCookie(...).setHttpOnly(true).setSecure(true).setSameSite("Lax")` (Internal cookie creation/setting method)
    *   **Role**: Initializes the cookie object with critical security attributes (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax`), `Path`, and `Max-Age`.

### 4. Key Operations

1.  **Request Validation**: Ensures the incoming `LoginRequest` payload is well-formed and contains all necessary fields (`username`, `password`). This prevents malformed requests from proceeding.
2.  **User Retrieval**: Fetches the user's account details from the database based on the provided username. This is a critical step for subsequent password validation.
3.  **Password Validation**: Securely compares the provided plain-text password with the stored, hashed password. This uses a robust hashing algorithm (`PasswordEncoder`) to ensure password security.
4.  **JWT Generation**: Creates a cryptographically signed JSON Web Token (JWT). This token encapsulates essential user identity information and session validity, which the client will use for subsequent authenticated requests.
5.  **Cookie Management**: Constructs a highly secure HTTP cookie (`auth_token`) that contains the generated JWT. The cookie is configured with specific attributes (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`) to enhance security and prevent various types of attacks.
6.  **Response Construction**: Builds the HTTP `200 OK` response, including the `Set-Cookie` header to deliver the `auth_token` cookie to the client, and a success message in the response body.

### 5. Dependencies

*   **Request/Response Entities**:
    *   `LoginRequest`: Data Transfer Object (DTO) for incoming login credentials.
    *   `AuthenticationResult`: DTO for the successful response payload.
    *   `User` entity (or similar, e.g., `UserDetails`): Represents the user record in the database.
*   **Services**:
    *   `AuthenticationService`: Core service orchestrating the authentication flow.
    *   `UserService`: Service for user-related business logic (e.g., retrieving user details).
    *   `CookieService`: Utility service for creating and managing secure HTTP cookies.
    *   `JwtTokenProvider`: Service responsible for JWT creation, signing, and potentially validation.
*   **Libraries / Utilities**:
    *   `PasswordEncoder` (e.g., Spring Security's `BCryptPasswordEncoder`): For secure password hashing and comparison.
    *   JWT Library (e.g., `jjwt` or `auth0-java-jwt`): For building, signing, and parsing JSON Web Tokens.
    *   Spring Web MVC (Controller, `ResponseEntity`, `@RequestBody`, etc.): Framework components for handling HTTP requests and responses.
    *   Database driver and ORM (e.g., Hibernate, JDBC): For `UserRepository` to interact with the database.
    *   Logging utility (e.g., SLF4J/Logback): For internal logging of events and errors.
*   **Database Entities/Tables**:
    *   `users` table: Stores user credentials and profile information.

### 6. Security Features

*   **Password Hashing**: User passwords are never stored in plain text. Instead, they are hashed using a strong, one-way cryptographic algorithm (e.g., BCrypt via `PasswordEncoder`), preventing direct exposure even if the database is compromised.
*   **JWT Signing**: The generated JWTs are digitally signed using a secret key. This ensures the token's integrity, meaning any tampering (e.g., altering the user ID) will be detected, and the token will be rejected.
*   **JWT Expiration**: JWTs are issued with an expiration time (`Max-Age` in cookie, `exp` claim in JWT). This limits the window of opportunity for token misuse if it is compromised, requiring re-authentication after a set period.
*   **HttpOnly Cookie**: The `auth_token` cookie is marked `HttpOnly`. This prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie, significantly mitigating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks where malicious scripts might attempt to steal session tokens.
*   **Secure Cookie**: The `auth_token` cookie is marked `Secure`. This ensures the cookie is only transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections, protecting it from interception by eavesdroppers on unencrypted networks.
*   **SameSite=Lax Cookie**: The `auth_token` cookie is marked `SameSite=Lax`. This provides robust protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by preventing the browser from sending the cookie with most cross-site requests, except for top-level navigations via GET requests.
*   **Input Validation**: Basic input validation is performed on the `LoginRequest` payload to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection (if input was directly used in queries, which it isn't here due to ORM) or malformed data attacks.
*   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: While not explicitly in the call hierarchy, it's assumed that appropriate CORS policies are configured at the application level to control which origins are allowed to make requests to this endpoint, preventing unauthorized cross-origin access.

### 7. Error Handling

*   **Invalid Input (`400 Bad Request`)**: If the `LoginRequest` payload is malformed (e.g., missing `username` or `password`), the system returns a `400 Bad Request` status code. The response body typically includes a clear error message indicating which fields are invalid.
*   **Authentication Failure (`401 Unauthorized`)**: If the provided `username` or `password` does not match any registered user, the system returns a `401 Unauthorized` status code. The response body will contain a generic error message (e.g., "Invalid credentials") to avoid leaking information about which specific detail (username or password) was incorrect.
*   **Internal Server Errors (`500 Internal Server Error`)**: Unexpected errors, such as database connection issues, failures during JWT signing, or unhandled exceptions within the service layer, result in a `500 Internal Server Error`. These errors are typically logged at an appropriate severity level (e.g., ERROR) for debugging and monitoring purposes.
*   **Logging**: All significant errors (e.g., authentication failures, internal exceptions) are logged with sufficient detail (stack traces, relevant request context) to aid in troubleshooting and monitoring. Error messages returned to the client are kept generic to avoid exposing sensitive internal details.
*   **Structured Error Responses**: In case of errors, the response body will typically follow a consistent JSON structure, including fields like `errorCode`, `message`, and potentially `timestamp` or `path`.

### 8. Performance Considerations

*   **Efficient Database Lookup**: The `UserRepository.findByUsername` operation should be optimized with database indexing on the `username` column to ensure quick user retrieval, minimizing database query latency.
*   **Optimized Password Hashing**: While password hashing is computationally intensive for security, `PasswordEncoder` implementations are designed to be efficient enough for typical login scenarios without introducing significant latency.
*   **Minimal JWT Payload**: The JWT payload is kept concise, containing only necessary claims (e.g., user ID, roles, expiration). This minimizes the size of the JWT and, consequently, the `Set-Cookie` header, reducing network overhead on subsequent requests.
*   **Caching (Potential)**: While not explicitly detailed, in high-volume scenarios, a caching layer for user details (e.g., `UserService.findByUsername` results) could be considered, especially for frequently accessed user accounts, to reduce database load.
*   **Metrics Collection**: The endpoint is instrumented (or can be) to collect performance metrics such as response time, request volume, and success/failure rates. These metrics are crucial for monitoring the endpoint's health and performance in production.

### 9. Usage Pattern

*   **Typical Use Case**: This endpoint is primarily used by client applications (web browsers, mobile apps) as the initial step to authenticate a user and establish a secure session. It is typically invoked when a user explicitly attempts to log in to the application.
*   **Context**: It is generally called after a user provides their credentials on a login form.
*   **Prerequisites**:
    *   The user must have an existing account registered in the system.
    *   The client application must be capable of handling HTTP `Set-Cookie` headers and automatically managing session cookies for subsequent requests.
*   **Subsequent Actions**: After a successful login, the client's browser will automatically attach the `auth_token` cookie to all subsequent requests to protected endpoints within the same domain. These protected endpoints will then validate the JWT within the cookie to authorize access.

### 10. Additional Notes (Optional)

*   **Stateless Session Management**: This endpoint facilitates a stateless session management approach leveraging JWTs. The server does not maintain session state for logged-in users, making the system more scalable and easier to deploy across multiple instances.
*   **No Direct Token Refresh**: This endpoint does not directly handle token refresh. For long-lived sessions, a separate endpoint or mechanism might be implemented to allow clients to refresh their JWTs before expiration without requiring full re-authentication, enhancing user experience and security.
*   **Rate Limiting**: It is highly recommended to implement rate limiting on this endpoint to protect against brute-force password guessing attacks. This limits the number of login attempts from a single IP address or user within a specified time frame. (Assumption, but crucial for security).
