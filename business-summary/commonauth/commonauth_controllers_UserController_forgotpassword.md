## API Endpoint Documentation: User Login

### 1. Endpoint Overview

*   **Endpoint Path**: `/auth/login`
*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Consumes**: `application/json`
*   **Produces**: `application/json`
*   **Purpose**: This endpoint facilitates user authentication. It accepts user credentials (username and password), validates them against the system's user store, and if successful, issues a pair of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) – an access token and a refresh token – to establish a secure session. These tokens are primarily delivered via secure HTTP-only cookies, with an optional duplicate in the response body for flexible client-side handling.
*   **Controller Method**: `AuthRestController.authenticateUser`
    *   **Primary Function**: Handles incoming login requests, orchestrates the authentication process, token generation, and secure cookie management to enable user access to protected resources.

### 2. Request and Response

*   **Request Type**:
    *   **Payload Structure**: `application/json`
    ```json
    {
      "username": "user.email@example.com",
      "password": "securePassword123"
    }
    ```
    *   **Input Parameters**:
        *   `username` (String): The user's unique identifier, typically an email address. (Required)
        *   `password` (String): The user's secret password. (Required)

*   **Response Type**:
    *   **Success Response (HTTP 200 OK)**:
        *   **Payload Structure**: `application/json`
        ```json
        {
          "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1Ni...", // Base64 encoded JWT
          "refreshToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1Ni..." // Base64 encoded JWT
        }
        ```
        *   **Headers**:
            *   `Set-Cookie`: Two `Set-Cookie` headers will be present, one for the access token and one for the refresh token. These cookies are configured with security flags (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`).
                *   Example (simplified):
                    *   `Set-Cookie: accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1Ni...; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Max-Age=900`
                    *   `Set-Cookie: refreshToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1Ni...; Path=/auth/refresh; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Max-Age=2592000`
        *   **Cookies**:
            *   `accessToken`: An HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookie containing the short-lived JWT access token.
            *   `refreshToken`: An HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookie containing the long-lived JWT refresh token.
    *   **Error Response**:
        *   **HTTP 400 Bad Request**: If the request payload is malformed or missing required fields (e.g., empty username/password).
            ```json
            {
              "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:00:00Z",
              "status": 400,
              "error": "Bad Request",
              "message": "Validation failed: 'username' must not be empty"
            }
            ```
        *   **HTTP 401 Unauthorized**: If the provided username or password is incorrect.
            ```json
            {
              "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:00:00Z",
              "status": 401,
              "error": "Unauthorized",
              "message": "Invalid username or password"
            }
            ```
        *   **HTTP 500 Internal Server Error**: For unexpected server-side issues (e.g., database connectivity problems, unhandled exceptions).
            ```json
            {
              "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:00:00Z",
              "status": 500,
              "error": "Internal Server Error",
              "message": "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later."
            }
            ```

### 3. Call Hierarchy

The following outlines the sequence of method calls and operations performed when the `/auth/login` endpoint is invoked:

*   **`AuthRestController.authenticateUser(LoginRequest loginRequest, HttpServletResponse response)`**
    *   Receives the incoming `LoginRequest` containing user credentials.
    *   Performs initial validation on `loginRequest` (e.g., checking for null or empty fields).
    *   Invokes `authService.authenticate(loginRequest.getUsername(), loginRequest.getPassword())`.
        *   **`AuthService.authenticate(String username, String password)`**
            *   Constructs a `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` using the provided username and password.
            *   Calls `authenticationManager.authenticate(authenticationToken)`.
                *   This is a core Spring Security component. It internally calls `UserDetailsService.loadUserByUsername(username)` to retrieve user details from the database.
                *   It then verifies the provided `password` against the stored hashed password.
                *   If authentication fails (e.g., bad credentials), a `BadCredentialsException` is thrown.
            *   If authentication is successful, retrieves the `UserDetails` object.
            *   Invokes `jwtTokenProvider.generateAccessToken(userDetails)` to create a short-lived JWT access token.
            *   Invokes `jwtTokenProvider.generateRefreshToken(userDetails)` to create a long-lived JWT refresh token.
            *   Calls `refreshTokenService.storeRefreshToken(userDetails.getUserId(), refreshToken)` to persist the refresh token in the database.
            *   Calls `cookieUtil.createAccessTokenCookie(accessToken)` to prepare the `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite` cookie for the access token.
            *   Calls `cookieUtil.createRefreshTokenCookie(refreshToken)` to prepare the `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite` cookie for the refresh token.
            *   Constructs an `AuthResponseDto` containing the generated `accessToken` and `refreshToken` for the response body.
            *   Returns the `AuthResponseDto`.
    *   Upon receiving the `AuthResponseDto` and cookie objects from `AuthService`, adds the generated `accessToken` and `refreshToken` cookies to the `HttpServletResponse` object using `response.addCookie()`.
    *   Returns a `ResponseEntity` containing the `AuthResponseDto` and an `HttpStatus.OK` (200) status code.

### 4. Key Operations

1.  **Request Validation**: Ensures that the incoming `LoginRequest` adheres to the defined structure and constraints (e.g., username and password are not empty). This prevents malformed requests and basic injection attempts.
2.  **User Authentication**: Verifies the authenticity of the user's provided credentials against the system's stored user information. This is handled securely by Spring Security's authentication manager, which uses hashed passwords.
3.  **JWT Generation**: Creates two distinct JSON Web Tokens:
    *   **Access Token**: A short-lived token used for authorizing subsequent requests to protected resources.
    *   **Refresh Token**: A long-lived token used to obtain new access tokens once the current one expires, without requiring the user to re-authenticate with their credentials.
4.  **Refresh Token Persistence**: The generated refresh token is stored in the database, linked to the user. This allows for token invalidation and management.
5.  **Secure Cookie Management**: The generated JWTs (both access and refresh) are packaged into highly secure cookies with specific attributes:
    *   `HttpOnly`: Prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie, mitigating XSS attacks.
    *   `Secure`: Ensures the cookie is only sent over HTTPS connections, protecting against eavesdropping.
    *   `SameSite`: Configured to `Lax` or `Strict` to mitigate Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by controlling when cookies are sent with cross-site requests.
6.  **Response Construction**: Formats the successful authentication response, including the optional token details in the JSON body and setting the critical `Set-Cookie` headers in the HTTP response.

### 5. Dependencies

*   **Request/Response Entities (DTOs)**:
    *   `LoginRequest`: Data Transfer Object (DTO) for the incoming login payload.
    *   `AuthResponseDto`: DTO for the outgoing authentication response payload.
*   **Services/Libraries**:
    *   `AuthService`: Orchestrates the core authentication flow.
    *   `JwtTokenProvider`: Utility service responsible for generating and validating JWTs.
    *   `RefreshTokenService`: Manages the persistence and retrieval of refresh tokens in the database.
    *   `CookieUtil`: Utility service for creating and managing secure HTTP cookies.
    *   `AuthenticationManager` (from Spring Security): Core component for user authentication.
    *   `UserDetailsService` (from Spring Security): Interface for retrieving user details from a data source.
    *   `io.jsonwebtoken` (or similar JWT library): Used for JWT creation, signing, and parsing.
*   **Database Entities/Tables**:
    *   `users` table: Stores user credentials (hashed passwords), roles, and other user-specific information.
    *   `refresh_tokens` table: Stores valid refresh tokens, associated with user IDs and expiration dates.
*   **Frameworks/Utilities**:
    *   Spring Framework (Spring Boot, Spring Web): Provides the REST controller and dependency injection.
    *   Spring Security: Handles authentication, authorization, and integrates with `AuthenticationManager` and `UserDetailsService`.
    *   Lombok: Used for boilerplate code reduction in DTOs (e.g., getters, setters, constructors).
    *   SLF4j/Logback: Logging utility for debugging and monitoring.

### 6. Security Features

*   **Password Hashing**: User passwords are never stored in plain text. They are hashed using a strong, one-way cryptographic algorithm (e.g., BCrypt) before being stored and are compared securely during authentication.
*   **JWT Security**:
    *   **Signing**: Both access and refresh tokens are digitally signed using a secret key, ensuring their integrity and authenticity. Any tampering with the token payload will invalidate the signature.
    *   **Expiration**: Tokens are issued with a finite lifetime (`exp` claim). Access tokens are short-lived (e.g., 15 minutes), minimizing the window of opportunity for misuse if intercepted. Refresh tokens are long-lived (e.g., 7-30 days) but are designed for single use or rotation.
*   **Cookie Security**:
    *   **`HttpOnly`**: Crucially prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the JWTs stored in cookies. This is a primary defense against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
    *   **`Secure`**: Ensures that cookies are only transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections, protecting them from eavesdropping during transit.
    *   **`SameSite`**: Set to `Lax` or `Strict` to mitigate Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. `Lax` sends cookies with top-level navigations and `GET` requests, while `Strict` only sends cookies with requests originating from the same site.
*   **Input Validation**: Strict validation of the incoming request payload (`LoginRequest`) prevents common attacks like SQL injection (by ensuring proper data types and formats) and malformed requests.
*   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: While not directly handled by this endpoint, a global CORS configuration is assumed to be in place to define which origins are allowed to access this API, preventing unauthorized cross-origin requests.
*   **Stateless Authentication (via JWTs)**: By using JWTs, the server does not need to maintain session state for each user, which enhances scalability and reduces the attack surface compared to traditional session management.

### 7. Error Handling

Error handling within this endpoint is robust and designed to provide clear feedback to clients while protecting sensitive information.

*   **Types of Errors Handled**:
    *   **Validation Errors**: If the `LoginRequest` body is malformed or missing required fields, a `400 Bad Request` is returned with specific validation error messages.
    *   **Authentication Failures**: If the provided username or password does not match system records, a `BadCredentialsException` is caught, resulting in a `401 Unauthorized` response with a generic "Invalid username or password" message to prevent username enumeration attacks.
    *   **Internal Server Errors**: Any unhandled exceptions during the process (e.g., database connection issues, critical service failures) are caught by a global exception handler. These typically result in a `500 Internal Server Error` with a generic message, and detailed error logs are recorded internally for debugging.
*   **Logging**: All significant errors (e.g., authentication failures, unhandled exceptions) are logged with sufficient detail (e.g., stack traces) for developers to diagnose issues, but without exposing sensitive user data to the logs.
*   **Error Response Structure**: A consistent JSON error response structure is used across the API, providing `timestamp`, `status code`, `error type`, and a human-readable `message`. This allows client applications to parse and react to errors predictably.

### 8. Performance Considerations

*   **Efficient Authentication**: Leveraging Spring Security's optimized authentication flow ensures that user credential verification is performed efficiently, often with caching mechanisms for user details.
*   **Stateless Operations**: The use of JWTs makes the endpoint largely stateless after initial token generation, minimizing server-side memory consumption and improving scalability as the server doesn't need to maintain session information for each logged-in user.
*   **Optimized Database Operations**: Database interactions are limited to a single user lookup and a single refresh token insertion per login request, minimizing database load. Indices on user IDs and usernames ensure quick lookups.
*   **Minimal Response Overhead**: The JSON response payload is concise, containing only the necessary token strings. Cookie sizes are also kept minimal.
*   **Metrics Collection**: The system is designed to allow integration with monitoring tools (e.g., Micrometer, Prometheus) to collect endpoint performance metrics like response times, success rates, and error rates, enabling proactive performance monitoring and tuning.

### 9. Usage Pattern

This endpoint is the **primary entry point for user authentication** within the application.

*   **Typical Use Case**: A client application (e.g., web browser, mobile app) displays a login form to the user. Once the user enters their credentials and submits the form, the client sends a `POST` request to `/auth/login` with the username and password in the request body.
*   **Prerequisites**:
    *   The user must have an existing account registered in the system.
    *   The client application must be configured to handle HTTP-only, secure cookies or manage tokens from the response body securely.
*   **Subsequent Actions**:
    *   Upon successful login, the client receives the `accessToken` and `refreshToken` via `Set-Cookie` headers.
    *   For subsequent requests to protected API endpoints, the client's browser or HTTP client will automatically send the `accessToken` cookie.
    *   If the `accessToken` expires, the client can use the `refreshToken` (typically by sending it to a separate `/auth/refresh` endpoint) to obtain a new valid `accessToken` without requiring the user to re-enter their credentials.

### 10. Additional Notes

*   **Token Lifespan**: Access tokens are typically short-lived (e.g., 15 minutes) to enhance security by limiting exposure time if compromised. Refresh tokens are long-lived (e.g., 7-30 days) but are secured by being `HttpOnly` and `Secure`.
*   **Refresh Token Invalidation**: A robust refresh token management strategy would include mechanisms for explicit refresh token invalidation (e.g., on logout, password change) and automatic invalidation upon detection of suspicious activity or single-use patterns. This endpoint handles the *storage* of the refresh token; its lifecycle management typically resides in the `RefreshTokenService` and other related endpoints.
*   **Client-Side Storage**: While the tokens are primarily delivered via secure cookies, their inclusion in the response body provides flexibility. However, if clients store these tokens in less secure locations (e.g., browser's Local Storage), it increases the risk of XSS attacks leading to token theft. The recommended approach for web applications is to rely solely on the HttpOnly cookies.
*   **Scalability**: The stateless nature of JWTs makes this authentication flow highly scalable horizontally, as any server instance can validate a token without needing shared session state.
