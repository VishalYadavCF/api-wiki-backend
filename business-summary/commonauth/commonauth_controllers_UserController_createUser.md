## API Endpoint Documentation: User Authentication & Token Generation

### 1. Endpoint Overview

*   **Endpoint Path**: `/api/v1/auth/login`
*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Consumes**: `application/json`
*   **Produces**: `application/json`
*   **Brief Description**: This endpoint facilitates user authentication by verifying provided credentials. Upon successful authentication, it generates a short-lived access token and a longer-lived refresh token. These tokens are used for subsequent API calls and maintaining user sessions securely, primarily through HTTP-only cookies.
*   **Controller Method Name**: `AuthController.authenticateUserAndIssueTokens`
*   **Primary Function**: User authentication, JWT (JSON Web Token) generation (both access and refresh tokens), and secure session establishment via cookies.

### 2. Request and Response

*   **Request Type (Payload Structure)**:
    *   The request expects a JSON payload containing user credentials.
    ```json
    {
      "username": "user.example@example.com",
      "password": "securePassword123!"
    }
    ```
    *   **Input Parameters**:
        *   `username` (String): The user's unique identifier (e.g., email address or username).
        *   `password` (String): The user's plain-text password.
*   **Response Type (Entity and Structure)**:
    *   **Success Response (HTTP 200 OK)**:
        *   **Payload**: A JSON object containing the access token. The refresh token is typically *not* returned in the body but is set as an `HttpOnly` cookie for enhanced security.
        ```json
        {
          "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c",
          "tokenType": "Bearer",
          "expiresIn": 3600 // Access token validity in seconds (e.g., 1 hour)
        }
        ```
        *   **Headers**:
            *   `Set-Cookie`: Two `Set-Cookie` headers will be present:
                *   `access_token=<JWT>; Path=/; Domain=yourdomain.com; Max-Age=3600; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax` (for the access token)
                *   `refresh_token=<JWT>; Path=/api/v1/auth/refresh; Domain=yourdomain.com; Max-Age=604800; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax` (for the refresh token)
            *   Other standard headers (e.g., `Content-Type: application/json`).
        *   **Cookies**:
            *   `access_token`: Stores the generated access JWT. Short-lived, `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax`.
            *   `refresh_token`: Stores the generated refresh JWT. Longer-lived, `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax`.

### 3. Call Hierarchy

The following outlines the logical flow and method calls executed when a request hits this endpoint:

1.  **`AuthController.authenticateUserAndIssueTokens(LoginRequest loginRequest, HttpServletResponse response)`**
    *   **Role**: Entry point for the API call. Handles initial request parsing and orchestrates the authentication and token issuance process.

        *   Invokes the `UserService` to verify credentials.
        *   Generates JWTs (access and refresh).
        *   Persists the refresh token.
        *   Constructs and adds secure cookies to the HTTP response.
        *   Prepares the success response payload.

2.  **`UserService.authenticateUser(String username, String password)`**

### 4. Key Operations

1.  **User Credential Validation**: Ensures that the incoming request contains valid `username` and `password` fields and that they meet basic formatting rules.
2.  **Password Verification**: Securely compares the user-provided password with the stored hashed password using a strong cryptographic hashing algorithm (e.g., BCrypt or Argon2), preventing brute-force attacks and protecting credentials even if the database is compromised.
3.  **Access Token Generation (JWT)**: Creates a signed JWT for authorization. This token is short-lived and contains essential user information (claims) used to authorize subsequent API requests.
4.  **Refresh Token Generation (JWT)**: Creates a separate, longer-lived signed JWT specifically for renewing expired access tokens without requiring the user to re-enter credentials. This improves user experience while maintaining security.
5.  **Refresh Token Persistence**: Stores a record of the refresh token (or its ID) in a database. This allows the server to track and potentially revoke refresh tokens, adding an important layer of security for session management.
6.  **Secure Cookie Creation and Management**:
    *   Sets both access and refresh tokens as `HttpOnly` cookies to prevent client-side JavaScript access, mitigating XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.
    *   Sets `Secure` attribute to ensure cookies are only sent over HTTPS/SSL connections, protecting them from eavesdropping.
    *   Sets `SameSite=Lax` or `Strict` to mitigate CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks by restricting when cookies are sent with cross-site requests.
7.  **Response Formulation**: Constructs the JSON response body (containing the access token details) and adds the `Set-Cookie` headers to the HTTP response, finalizing the successful authentication process.

### 5. Dependencies

*   **Request/Response Entities (DTOs)**:
    *   `LoginRequest`: Data Transfer Object (DTO) for incoming login credentials.

    *   `Spring Web`: For handling HTTP requests and responses.
    *   `javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse`: For direct manipulation of HTTP response (e.g., adding cookies).

### 6. Security Features

*   **JWT Security**:
    *   **Signing**: All generated JWTs are digitally signed using a strong secret key (e.g., HS256), ensuring their integrity and authenticity.
    *   **Expiration**: Access tokens are short-lived (e.g., 1 hour) to minimize the impact of token compromise. Refresh tokens are longer-lived but can be revoked.
    *   **Stateless Access Tokens**: Once issued, access tokens are self-contained and don't require server-side lookup for validation, reducing load and improving scalability.
*   **Cookie Security**:
    *   **`HttpOnly`**: Prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie, mitigating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
    *   **`Secure`**: Ensures cookies are only sent over encrypted HTTPS connections, protecting them from interception.
    *   **`SameSite=Lax` (or `Strict`)**: Provides protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by restricting when cookies are sent with cross-site requests.
*   **Password Security**: User passwords are never stored in plain text. They are hashed using a strong, one-way cryptographic function (e.g., BCrypt), with salting, preventing them from being recovered even if the database is breached.
*   **Input Validation**: Basic input validation is performed on the username and password to prevent common injection attacks and ensure data integrity before processing.
*   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Handling**: The API likely has a global CORS configuration to define which origins are allowed to make requests to this endpoint, preventing unauthorized cross-origin requests.
*   **Session Management**: A combination of short-lived access tokens and longer-lived, revocable refresh tokens provides a robust and secure session management strategy. Refresh tokens are typically persisted to allow for server-side revocation.

### 7. Error Handling

*   **Types of Errors Handled**:
    *   **Invalid Credentials (Authentication Failure)**: Occurs if the username/password combination does not match.
    *   **Bad Request/Validation Errors**: If the input payload is malformed, missing required fields, or fails basic validation rules.
    *   **Internal Server Errors**: Generic errors due to unexpected issues (e.g., database connection problems, token generation failures).
*   **Error Logging**: All errors are logged to the application's internal logging system (e.g., using `slf4j` and Logback) with appropriate log levels (e.g., `WARN` for bad requests, `ERROR` for internal failures) to aid in debugging and monitoring. Sensitive information (like passwords) is never logged.
*   **Error Response Structure**:
    *   Errors are typically returned with appropriate HTTP status codes and a standardized JSON error payload to the client.
    *   **Example Invalid Credentials Response (HTTP 401 Unauthorized)**:
        ```json
        {
          "status": 401,
          "error": "Unauthorized",
          "message": "Invalid username or password."
        }
        ```
    *   **Example Bad Request Response (HTTP 400 Bad Request)**:
        ```json
        {
          "status": 400,
          "error": "Bad Request",
          "message": "Username and password are required.",
          "details": [
            { "field": "username", "message": "cannot be empty" }
          ]
        }
        ```
*   **Exception Handling**: The controller often leverages global exception handlers (e.g., `@ControllerAdvice` in Spring) to catch specific exception types (`AuthenticationException`, `MethodArgumentNotValidException`) and transform them into consistent HTTP error responses.

### 8. Performance Considerations

*   **Efficient Password Hashing**: While password hashing is computationally intensive, the chosen algorithm (e.g., BCrypt) is optimized for performance while maintaining high security.
*   **Optimized Database Operations**: User lookup by username is typically indexed on the `username` column in the database to ensure fast retrieval. Refresh token storage and lookup are also optimized for speed.
*   **Minimal Cookie Size**: The access and refresh tokens stored in cookies are kept as compact as possible (by minimizing claims) to reduce request/response overhead.
*   **Stateless Access Tokens**: Once an access token is issued, subsequent API calls using this token do not require a database lookup for user authentication, significantly improving performance for authorized requests.
*   **Metrics Collection**: The endpoint is likely instrumented with metrics collection (e.g., using Spring Boot Actuator with Prometheus/Grafana) to monitor response times, error rates, and throughput, allowing for performance bottlenecks to be identified and addressed.

### 9. Usage Pattern

This endpoint is the initial step for a user to gain access to protected resources.

*   **Typical Use Case**: A user attempts to log in to a web or mobile application by providing their credentials.
*   **Prerequisites**:
    *   The user must have a pre-existing account registered in the system.
    *   The user's credentials must be correct.
*   **Flow**:
    1.  The client application (e.g., React frontend, mobile app) sends a `POST` request to `/api/v1/auth/login` with the username and password in the JSON body.
    2.  Upon successful authentication, the server responds with HTTP 200 OK, a JSON payload containing the access token, and `Set-Cookie` headers for both the access and refresh tokens.
    3.  The client's browser automatically stores these `HttpOnly` and `Secure` cookies.
    4.  For subsequent API calls to protected resources, the browser automatically sends the `access_token` cookie (and later the `refresh_token` cookie if the access token expires).
    5.  If the access token expires, the client application can trigger a request to a `/api/v1/auth/refresh` endpoint (not described here) using the `refresh_token` cookie to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to re-login.

### 10. Additional Notes

*   **Token Revocation**: While refresh tokens are persistent, the system likely includes a mechanism to explicitly revoke them (e.g., via a logout endpoint or administrator action), invalidating future attempts to use that token for access.
*   **JWT Secret Management**: The secret keys used for signing JWTs are critical assets and are securely managed (e.g., stored in environment variables, secret management services like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault) and rotated periodically.
*   **Rate Limiting**: To prevent brute-force attacks on the login endpoint, it's highly recommended (though not explicitly in the call hierarchy) to implement rate limiting based on IP address or username to restrict the number of login attempts within a certain time frame.
*   **Assumptions**: This documentation assumes a Spring Boot backend with standard security practices and a relational database for user and token storage. Specific library versions or database types would need to be confirmed by the system owner.
