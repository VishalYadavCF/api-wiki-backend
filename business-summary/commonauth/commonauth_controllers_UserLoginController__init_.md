        *   **HTTP Status: 404 Not Found:** Returned if the specified username does not exist in the system.
            *   **Body:** A structured JSON object (e.g., `{"errorCode": "USER_NOT_FOUND", "message": "User not found."}`).

**3. Call Hierarchy**

The `AuthController.authenticateUser` method orchestrates a series of operations to process a login request:

*   **`AuthController.authenticateUser(LoginRequest loginRequest)`**
    *   **Input Validation:**
        *   Calls `ValidationUtil.validateLoginRequest(loginRequest)`: This utility method performs initial checks on the incoming request payload (e.g., ensuring fields are not empty).
            *   *Purpose:* Prevents processing of malformed requests early.
            *   *Output:* Returns a boolean indicating validity or throws an exception (e.g., `MethodArgumentNotValidException`) if invalid, which is caught by a global error handler.
    *   **User Retrieval:**
        *   Calls `UserService.findByUsername(loginRequest.getUsername())`: Retrieves user details from the persistence layer based on the provided username.
            *   *Purpose:* To obtain the user's stored password hash and other relevant account information.
            *   *Output:* A `UserEntity` object containing user data (e.g., `userId`, `passwordHash`, `roles`).
            *   *Potential Error:* Throws `UserNotFoundException` if the username doesn't correspond to an existing user.
    *   **Password Verification:**
        *   Calls `PasswordEncoder.matches(loginRequest.getPassword(), userEntity.getPasswordHash())`: Compares the plain-text password from the request with the securely hashed password stored in the `UserEntity`.
            *   *Purpose:* Verifies the user's identity without exposing the actual password.
            *   *Output:* A boolean.
            *   *Potential Error:* Throws `BadCredentialsException` if the passwords do not match.
    *   **Access Token Generation:**
        *   Calls `JwtTokenService.generateAccessToken(userEntity.getUserId(), userEntity.getRoles())`: Creates a short-lived JSON Web Token (JWT) containing basic user information (e.g., user ID, roles).
            *   *Purpose:* This token grants access to protected resources for a limited duration.
            *   *Internal Call:* Internally invokes `JwtUtil.createToken(claims, secret, expiration)` to handle the actual JWT signing and structure.
            *   *Output:* The signed JWT string.
    *   **Refresh Token Generation:**
        *   Calls `JwtTokenService.generateRefreshToken(userEntity.getUserId())`: Creates a long-lived JWT specifically for obtaining new access tokens without requiring re-authentication.
            *   *Purpose:* Enhances user experience by prolonging session without compromising security.
            *   *Internal Call:* Internally invokes `JwtUtil.createToken(claims, secret, expiration)`.
            *   *Output:* The signed refresh token string.
    *   **Refresh Token Persistence:**
        *   Calls `RefreshTokenRepository.save(new RefreshTokenEntity(refreshToken, userId, expiry))`: Stores the generated refresh token in the database.
            *   *Purpose:* Allows for server-side revocation of refresh tokens (e.g., on logout or security breach) and provides a record for active sessions.
            *   *Output:* The persisted `RefreshTokenEntity`.
    *   **Cookie Creation:**
        *   Calls `CookieUtil.createHttpOnlyCookie("accessToken", accessToken, expiration)`: Encapsulates the access token into a secure HTTP-only cookie.
        *   Calls `CookieUtil.createHttpOnlyCookie("refreshToken", refreshToken, expiration)`: Encapsulates the refresh token into a secure HTTP-only cookie.
            *   *Purpose:* Securely delivers tokens to the client, protecting them from client-side JavaScript access and ensuring they are sent only over secure channels.
            *   *Output:* `HttpCookie` objects.
    *   **Response Construction:**
        *   Calls `AuthResponse.buildSuccessResponse(accessToken, refreshToken)`: Assembles the final HTTP 200 OK response, including the tokens in the body and the secure cookies in the headers.
            *   *Purpose:* Formats the successful outcome for the client.
            *   *Output:* A `ResponseEntity<AuthResponse>`.

**4. Key Operations**

1.  **Request Validation:** Ensures that the incoming request adheres to expected formats and contains all required data before processing.
2.  **User Authentication:** Securely verifies the user's identity by hashing the provided password and comparing it against the stored hash.
3.  **Token Generation (Access & Refresh):** Creates two distinct types of JWTs â€“ a short-lived access token for API calls and a long-lived refresh token for obtaining new access tokens.
4.  **Refresh Token Persistence:** Stores the refresh token in the database, enabling server-side management and revocation capabilities.
5.  **Secure Cookie Management:** Packages the generated tokens into HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite cookies, crucial for protecting them from client-side script access, ensuring transmission over HTTPS, and mitigating CSRF attacks.

**5. Dependencies**

*   **Data Models/DTOs:**
    *   `LoginRequest`: Represents the input payload for the login request.
    *   `AuthResponse`: Represents the successful response payload containing tokens.
    *   `UserEntity`: Database entity storing user details (username, password hash, roles).
    *   `RefreshTokenEntity`: Database entity for persisting refresh tokens.
    *   `ErrorResponse`: Standardized structure for error messages returned to the client.
*   **Services:**
    *   `UserService`: Handles business logic related to user management, specifically retrieving user details.
    *   `JwtTokenService`: Responsible for the logic of generating both access and refresh JWTs.
    *   `RefreshTokenRepository`: Data Access Object (DAO) for interacting with the database to store and retrieve `RefreshTokenEntity` objects.
*   **Libraries/Utilities:**
    *   `PasswordEncoder`: (e.g., Spring Security's `BCryptPasswordEncoder`) for secure password hashing and comparison.
    *   `JwtUtil`: A utility class for core JWT operations like creation, signing, and parsing.
    *   `ValidationUtil`: A utility class for validating incoming request payloads.
    *   `CookieUtil`: A utility class for constructing secure HTTP cookie objects.
*   **Frameworks:**
    *   Spring Framework (for dependency injection, MVC controllers, service components).
    *   Spring Security (underpins password encoding and potentially authentication flows).
    *   JPA/Hibernate (for Object-Relational Mapping and database interactions).

**6. Security Features**

*   **Password Hashing:** Passwords are never stored or compared in plain text. A strong, one-way hashing algorithm (`PasswordEncoder`) is used to store and verify credentials, preventing their compromise even if the database is breached.
*   **Signed JWTs:** Both access and refresh tokens are digitally signed using a secret key. This ensures the integrity of the token (it hasn't been tampered with) and its authenticity (it was issued by a trusted server).
*   **Token Expiration:** Tokens are configured with specific expiration times. Access tokens are short-lived, minimizing the impact if intercepted. Refresh tokens have a longer lifespan but are still time-bound.
*   **HttpOnly Cookies:** Tokens are delivered to the client within `HttpOnly` cookies. This prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing these cookies, effectively mitigating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   **Secure Cookies:** Cookies are flagged as `Secure`, meaning they will only be sent over encrypted HTTPS connections, protecting them from eavesdropping.
*   **SameSite Cookies (`Lax`):** Cookies are configured with a `SameSite` policy (e.g., `Lax`), which helps protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by restricting when cookies are sent with cross-origin requests.
*   **Server-Side Refresh Token Storage:** Storing refresh tokens in the database allows for explicit revocation, providing a mechanism to invalidate sessions (e.g., on logout, password change, or security alert) even before their natural expiration.
*   **Input Validation:** Robust input validation prevents various injection attacks and ensures that only properly formatted and safe data is processed.

**7. Error Handling**

*   **Centralized Error Handling:** Errors are managed uniformly through a `GlobalExceptionHandler`, which catches exceptions thrown at any stage of the request processing.
*   **Specific Error Responses:** The endpoint provides clear, distinct error responses based on the failure type:
    *   `400 Bad Request`: For issues like missing fields or malformed JSON (e.g., caught from `ValidationUtil` failures).
    *   `401 Unauthorized`: For incorrect username/password combinations (e.g., caught from `PasswordEncoder` failure).
    *   `404 Not Found`: If the user account doesn't exist (e.g., caught from `UserService` not finding a user).
*   **Structured Error Payloads:** Error responses are formatted as consistent JSON objects, including an `errorCode` for programmatic handling and a human-readable `message` for debugging and user feedback.
*   **Internal Logging:** All errors are typically logged internally to assist with monitoring, debugging, and identifying potential security incidents, though specific logging calls are not detailed in the hierarchy.

**8. Performance Considerations**

*   **Efficient Database Lookups:** User retrieval (`UserService.findByUsername`) is optimized to use indexed database fields, ensuring fast query times. Similarly, refresh token storage and retrieval operations are designed for efficiency.
*   **Optimized Password Hashing:** While secure, the `PasswordEncoder` is typically chosen and configured to balance security strength with acceptable performance overhead.
*   **Stateless Access Tokens:** Once generated, access tokens are self-contained. Subsequent API calls using these tokens do not require a database lookup for validation, reducing the load on the database and enabling horizontal scaling of API servers.
*   **Minimal Cookie Size:** Cookies only contain the JWTs, keeping their size small to minimize network overhead on every request.
*   **Monitoring Metrics:** (Assumed) The system is likely instrumented to collect performance metrics (e.g., response times, error rates) for this endpoint, allowing for proactive performance tuning and bottleneck identification.

**9. Usage Pattern**

This endpoint is the initial step in establishing a user's authenticated session.

*   **Typical Use Case:** A user attempts to log in to an application (e.g., a web application, mobile app, or desktop client) after entering their credentials.
*   **Prerequisites:** The user must have a pre-existing account with a registered username and password in the system.
*   **Client Interaction Flow:**
    1.  The client collects the user's username and password.
    2.  It sends a `POST` request with these credentials as a JSON payload to `/auth/login`.
    3.  If successful (HTTP 200 OK), the server responds with the `accessToken` and `refreshToken` in the response body, and crucially, sets them as `HttpOnly` cookies in the `Set-Cookie` header.
    4.  The client-side application then relies on the browser to automatically manage and send these cookies with subsequent authenticated requests. The access token is used for direct API calls, and the refresh token is used to acquire a new access token once the current one expires, without requiring the user to re-enter credentials.

**10. Additional Notes**

*   **CORS Configuration:** For web applications hosted on a different domain than the API, appropriate Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies must be configured on the server to allow the client to make requests to this endpoint.
*   **Token Revocation Endpoint:** While refresh tokens are stored, a separate endpoint (e.g., `/auth/logout` or `/auth/revoke-token`) would typically be required to explicitly invalidate the refresh token on the server-side, forcing the user to re-authenticate.
*   **Environment-Specific Configuration:** JWT secret keys, token expiration times, and other security-sensitive parameters should be configured securely and externally for different deployment environments (development, staging, production).
*   **Rate Limiting:** (Assumed, but highly recommended) For production environments, implementing rate limiting on this endpoint is crucial to prevent brute-force login attempts and denial-of-service attacks.
