## API Endpoint Documentation: `auth/token/generate`

### 1. Endpoint Overview

*   **Endpoint Path**: `/api/auth/token/generate`
*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Consumes**: `application/json` (AuthRequest payload)
*   **Produces**: `application/json` (Status messages or minimal success response)
*   **Purpose**: This endpoint is responsible for initiating a secure session for a user by generating and distributing access and refresh tokens after successful authentication. It primarily focuses on token issuance and secure cookie management rather than direct user data retrieval.
*   **Controller Method**: `AuthEndpoint.generateToken`
*   **Primary Function**: To handle the final step of a user authentication flow, specifically generating JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for both access and refresh purposes, and setting these tokens securely as HttpOnly cookies in the client's browser.

### 2. Request and Response

*   **Request Type**:
    *   **Payload**: A JSON object (`AuthRequest`) containing the user's credentials (e.g., username and password).
    ```json
    {
        "username": "user.name@example.com",
        "password": "securePassword123"
    }
    ```
    *   **Parameters**: None in the path; all input is via the request body.
    *   **Headers**: `Content-Type: application/json` is required.

*   **Response Type**:
    *   **Success Response (200 OK)**:
        *   **Status Code**: `200 OK`
        *   **Payload**: A lightweight JSON object indicating success. No sensitive token data is returned in the body, as tokens are set via cookies.
        ```json
        {
            "message": "Authentication successful, tokens issued."
        }
        ```
        *   **Headers**: Standard HTTP headers, including `Set-Cookie` headers for both the access token and refresh token.
        *   **Cookies**:
            *   `accessToken`: Contains the short-lived JWT for API access. Configured as `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax`, with an appropriate `Max-Age` (short expiry).
            *   `refreshToken`: Contains the longer-lived JWT used to obtain new access tokens. Configured as `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax`, with a longer `Max-Age`.

    *   **Error Response**: (Refer to Section 7: Error Handling for details)
        *   Typical status codes: `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `500 Internal Server Error`.
        *   Payload: Standardized error response body (e.g., `{ "error": "Invalid credentials", "code": "AUTH_FAILED" }`).

### 3. Call Hierarchy

The `AuthEndpoint.generateToken` method orchestrates a series of operations to validate credentials, generate tokens, and set secure cookies.

1.  **`AuthEndpoint.generateToken(AuthRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)`**
    *   **Role**: Serves as the entry point for the API call. It handles the initial request validation, delegates to authentication and token services, and manages the HTTP response, particularly cookie setting.
    *   **Input**: `AuthRequest` (user credentials), `HttpServletResponse` (for setting cookies).
    *   **Output**: Success or error response; sets HTTP cookies.
    *   **Operations**:
        *   Performs initial validation of the `AuthRequest` (e.g., checks for non-null/empty username and password).
        *   Calls `AuthenticationService.authenticate`.
        *   Upon successful authentication, calls `TokenService.generateAccessToken` and `TokenService.generateRefreshToken`.
        *   Utilizes `CookieService.setAccessTokenCookie` and `CookieService.setRefreshTokenCookie` to add tokens to the response.
        *   Constructs and returns the success `ResponseEntity`.

2.  **`AuthenticationService.authenticate(AuthRequest request)`**
    *   **Role**: Core authentication logic. Verifies the provided credentials against the stored user data.
    *   **Input**: `AuthRequest` (username and password).
    *   **Output**: User details (e.g., a `User` entity or DTO) if authentication is successful; throws `AuthenticationException` otherwise.
    *   **Operations**:
        *   Retrieves user details from the database via `UserRepository.findByUsername(request.getUsername())`.
        *   Compares the provided password with the stored hashed password (often using a password encoder like BCrypt).
        *   If credentials match, returns the authenticated user's object.

3.  **`TokenService.generateAccessToken(User user)`**
    *   **Role**: Creates a short-lived JSON Web Token (JWT) intended for immediate API resource access.
    *   **Input**: `User` object (containing details like user ID, roles, etc.).
    *   **Output**: Signed access token (String).
    *   **Operations**:
        *   Calls `JwtUtility.createJwt(user, expirationTime, secretKey)` with a short expiration time (e.g., 15-30 minutes).
        *   Encodes relevant user information (e.g., user ID, roles) into the JWT claims.
        *   Signs the JWT using a configured secret key.

4.  **`TokenService.generateRefreshToken(User user)`**
    *   **Role**: Creates a longer-lived JWT used to request new access tokens when the current one expires, without requiring re-authentication with username/password.
    *   **Input**: `User` object.
    *   **Output**: Signed refresh token (String).
    *   **Operations**:
        *   Calls `JwtUtility.createJwt(user, longerExpirationTime, secretKey)` with a significantly longer expiration time (e.g., days or weeks).
        *   Encodes minimal user information into the JWT claims.
        *   Signs the JWT using the same or a different secret key.

5.  **`CookieService.setAccessTokenCookie(HttpServletResponse response, String accessToken)`**
    *   **Role**: Adds the generated access token as a secure cookie to the HTTP response.
    *   **Input**: `HttpServletResponse` and the `accessToken` string.
    *   **Output**: Modifies the `HttpServletResponse` to include the `Set-Cookie` header for the access token.
    *   **Operations**:
        *   Creates an `HttpCookie` object.
        *   Sets the `HttpOnly` flag to `true` (prevents client-side JavaScript access).
        *   Sets the `Secure` flag to `true` (ensures cookie is only sent over HTTPS).
        *   Sets the `SameSite` policy to `Lax` (provides protection against CSRF attacks).
        *   Sets the appropriate `Max-Age` based on the token's expiration.
        *   Adds the cookie to the `HttpServletResponse`.

6.  **`CookieService.setRefreshTokenCookie(HttpServletResponse response, String refreshToken)`**
    *   **Role**: Adds the generated refresh token as a secure cookie to the HTTP response.
    *   **Input**: `HttpServletResponse` and the `refreshToken` string.
    *   **Output**: Modifies the `HttpServletResponse` to include the `Set-Cookie` header for the refresh token.
    *   **Operations**:
        *   Similar to `setAccessTokenCookie`, but with the refresh token's longer `Max-Age`.
        *   Applies `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Lax` flags.

### 4. Key Operations

*   **Request Validation**: Ensures that the incoming `AuthRequest` contains all necessary fields (username, password) and adheres to basic format rules. This prevents malformed requests from reaching core logic.
*   **User Authentication**: Verifies the provided user credentials against the system's user store. This is a critical security gate, ensuring only legitimate users can proceed.
*   **Access Token Generation**: Creates a cryptographically signed JWT with a short lifespan. This token is used for authorizing subsequent API calls to protected resources.
*   **Refresh Token Generation**: Creates a separate, longer-lived cryptographically signed JWT. This token is used to obtain new access tokens once the current one expires, reducing the need for repeated full login with credentials.
*   **Secure Cookie Management**: Both access and refresh tokens are encapsulated within HTTP-only, secure, and SameSite-protected cookies. This significantly enhances client-side security by preventing JavaScript access to tokens and mitigating certain types of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   **User Details Retrieval**: Fetches comprehensive user information (like roles, permissions, unique ID) required for token generation and potential session management.

### 5. Dependencies

*   **Request/Response Entities**:
    *   `AuthRequest`: Data Transfer Object (DTO) for incoming authentication credentials.
    *   `User`: Entity or DTO representing the authenticated user's details, passed between services.
    *   `HttpServletResponse` (from Java Servlet API): Used by the controller and cookie service to set HTTP response headers and cookies.
*   **Services**:
    *   `AuthenticationService`: Encapsulates user authentication logic.
    *   `TokenService`: Handles the generation of JWTs (access and refresh tokens).
    *   `CookieService`: Manages the creation and setting of secure HTTP cookies.
*   **Libraries/Utilities**:
    *   `JwtUtility`: A helper library/class responsible for JWT creation, signing, and potentially parsing/validation.
    *   `UserRepository`: A data access component (e.g., Spring Data JPA Repository) for interacting with the user database.
    *   Password Encoder (e.g., BCryptPasswordEncoder): Used by `AuthenticationService` for secure password comparison.
    *   Logging Utility (e.g., SLF4J/Logback): For recording operational steps and errors.
*   **Database Entities/Tables**:
    *   `Users` table/entity: Stores user credentials and profile information.
    *   Potentially `Sessions` or `RefreshTokens` table (if refresh tokens are persisted or invalidated server-side, though not explicitly shown in this hierarchy).
*   **Frameworks**:
    *   Spring Framework (for Controllers, Services, Repositories, Dependency Injection).
    *   Spring Security (for authentication infrastructure and potentially token validation in other endpoints, though the core auth is custom here).

### 6. Security Features

*   **JWT Security**:
    *   **Signing**: Both access and refresh tokens are cryptographically signed using a strong secret key, ensuring their integrity and authenticity (i.e., they haven't been tampered with and originated from the legitimate server).
    *   **Expiration**: Tokens have defined expiration times, limiting the window of opportunity for attackers if a token is compromised. Access tokens are short-lived for frequent re-issuance, and refresh tokens are longer-lived for convenience.
*   **Cookie Security**:
    *   **HttpOnly**: Cookies are marked as `HttpOnly`, preventing client-side JavaScript from accessing them. This significantly reduces the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks stealing tokens.
    *   **Secure**: Cookies are marked as `Secure`, ensuring they are only sent over HTTPS connections. This protects tokens from being intercepted in plain text during transit.
    *   **SameSite=Lax**: The `SameSite` attribute with `Lax` policy provides protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by restricting when cookies are sent with cross-site requests.
*   **Input Validation**: Basic validation of `AuthRequest` payload helps prevent common injection attacks or malformed requests.
*   **Password Hashing**: User passwords are never stored in plain text. `AuthenticationService` compares hashed passwords, preventing exposure even if the database is breached.
*   **Stateless Access Tokens**: While refresh tokens might imply some state, access tokens are designed to be stateless, reducing server overhead and enabling horizontal scaling. Validation typically happens by verifying the token's signature and expiration.
*   **CORS Handling**: While not explicitly detailed in the hierarchy, a robust API typically implements Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies to define which origins are allowed to access the endpoint, preventing unauthorized cross-origin requests. (Assumption)

### 7. Error Handling

*   **Invalid Input**: If the `AuthRequest` fails validation (e.g., missing username/password), the endpoint will return a `400 Bad Request` status code with a descriptive error message.
*   **Authentication Failures**: If `AuthenticationService.authenticate` fails (e.g., incorrect username or password), an `AuthenticationException` is thrown. The controller catches this and returns a `401 Unauthorized` status code to the client, possibly with a generic "Invalid credentials" message to prevent username enumeration.
*   **Internal Server Errors**: Any unexpected exceptions during token generation, cookie setting, or database operations will typically result in a `500 Internal Server Error` status.
*   **Logging**: Errors are logged internally (e.g., using `SLF4J/Logback`) to provide traceability and aid debugging. Sensitive information is masked or omitted from logs.
*   **Error Response Structure**: For client-facing errors, a consistent JSON error response structure is returned, typically including a clear `message` and an optional `code` for programmatic error handling.

### 8. Performance Considerations

*   **Efficient Token Generation**: JWT creation (`JwtUtility.createJwt`) involves cryptographic operations, but these are generally optimized for speed. The process is designed to be quick, minimizing latency.
*   **Optimized Database Calls**: The `UserRepository.findByUsername` call should be indexed on the username field to ensure fast retrieval of user details. Minimizing additional database lookups beyond the initial authentication step helps maintain performance.
*   **Minimal Response Payload**: The success response returns a very small JSON payload, reducing network bandwidth usage and client processing time.
*   **Cookie Size**: The generated JWTs are designed to be compact, minimizing the size of HTTP headers and overall request/response overhead.
*   **Statelessness**: The use of stateless JWTs (primarily access tokens) allows the service to scale horizontally without complex session management across multiple instances, improving overall throughput.
*   **Monitoring**: It is assumed that metrics (e.g., request count, latency, error rates) are collected for this endpoint to monitor its performance and identify bottlenecks.

### 9. Usage Pattern

This endpoint is typically called by a client application (e.g., a web browser SPA, mobile app) as the final step in a user login or authentication flow.

1.  **User Initiates Login**: User provides username and password in the client application.
2.  **Client Calls Endpoint**: The client sends a `POST` request to `/api/auth/token/generate` with the `AuthRequest` payload.
3.  **Server Processes Request**: The server authenticates credentials and, if successful, generates and sets the access and refresh tokens as secure cookies.
4.  **Client Receives Cookies**: The client's browser automatically receives and stores the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` cookies. These cookies are not directly accessible via JavaScript.
5.  **Subsequent API Calls**: For protected resource access, the browser will automatically include the `accessToken` cookie in subsequent requests to the same domain (or specified paths), allowing the server to validate the user's session without requiring repeated credential input.
6.  **Token Refresh**: When the access token expires, the client can make a silent request (e.g., to a separate `/api/auth/token/refresh` endpoint, often triggered by an interceptor) using the `refreshToken` cookie to obtain a new `accessToken` without the user having to re-authenticate.

**Prerequisites**:
*   The user must have a valid, registered account in the system.
*   The client application must be configured to send the `AuthRequest` payload correctly.
*   The client's environment (e.g., browser) must support standard cookie mechanisms.

### 10. Additional Notes

*   **Refresh Token Revocation**: While not explicitly shown in the hierarchy, for enhanced security, refresh tokens should ideally be revocable server-side (e.g., by maintaining a blacklist or whitelist of tokens, or by associating them with server-side sessions). This allows for immediate invalidation upon logout or compromise. (Assumption based on best practices).
*   **Token Rotation**: For continuous security, mechanisms like refresh token rotation (where a new refresh token is issued with each access token refresh) are recommended.
*   **Environment Configuration**: The `secretKey` used for JWT signing should be managed securely as an environment variable and not hardcoded in the application. Different keys for access and refresh tokens may be used for an extra layer of security.
*   **Logging**: Production environments should have robust logging configured to capture authentication attempts (success and failure), token generation events, and any errors, without logging sensitive data.
