### API Endpoint Documentation: User Login and Session Establishment

---

### 1. Endpoint Overview

*   **Endpoint Path:** `/api/v1/auth/login`
*   **HTTP Method:** `POST`
*   **Consumes:** `application/json`
*   **Produces:** `application/json`
*   **Purpose:** This endpoint facilitates user authentication and establishes a secure session by issuing JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for both access and refresh purposes. These tokens are delivered via secure HTTP-only cookies and, optionally, within the response body.
*   **Controller Method:** `AuthController.login`
*   **Primary Function:** Authenticates a user's credentials (username and password), generates cryptographic tokens, and sets secure HTTP-only cookies to manage the user's session.

### 2. Request and Response

*   **Request Type:**
    *   **Payload Structure:** A JSON object (`LoginRequest`) containing the user's login credentials.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `username` (string, required): The user's unique identifier (e.g., email address or username).
        *   `password` (string, required): The user's plain-text password.
    *   **Example Request Body:**
        ```json
        {
          "username": "john.doe@example.com",
          "password": "MySuperSecurePassword123!"
        }
        ```
*   **Response Type (Success):**
    *   **Status Code:** `200 OK`
    *   **Payload Structure:** A JSON object (`AuthResponse`) containing the generated access token and refresh token. This provides flexibility for clients that prefer to manage tokens directly from the response body, though cookies are the primary delivery mechanism for browser-based clients.
    *   **Example Response Body:**
        ```json
        {
          "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
          "refreshToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
        }
        ```
    *   **Headers:** Standard HTTP headers, along with `Set-Cookie` headers for `auth_token` and `refresh_token`.
    *   **Cookies:**
        *   `auth_token`: Contains the JWT Access Token. Configured as `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` (e.g., `Lax` or `Strict`).
        *   `refresh_token`: Contains the JWT Refresh Token. Configured as `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` (e.g., `Lax` or `Strict`).

### 3. Call Hierarchy

The following outlines the sequence of method calls and their respective responsibilities within the endpoint's execution flow:

*   **`AuthController.login(LoginRequest loginRequest)`**
    *   **Role:** The primary entry point for the login request. It handles parsing the incoming `LoginRequest` and orchestrates the authentication and token issuance process.

            *   **Role:** Adds the created refresh token cookie to the HTTP response.
    *   **Returns:** A `ResponseEntity` object, typically with an `AuthResponse` payload and `HttpStatus.OK`.

### 4. Key Operations

*   **Request Validation:** Prior to processing, the `LoginRequest` payload is validated to ensure that `username` and `password` fields are present and meet basic format requirements.
*   **User Authentication:** The core process of verifying the user's identity by comparing the provided password with the stored hashed password. This involves retrieving user details and performing a cryptographic hash comparison.
*   **Token Generation:** Upon successful authentication, a short-lived Access Token (for immediate API calls) and a longer-lived Refresh Token (for acquiring new access tokens) are securely generated and signed.
*   **Cookie Management:** Secure HTTP-only cookies are meticulously crafted for both the access token and refresh token, configured with `Secure` and `SameSite` attributes to enhance security.
*   **Cookie Attachment:** The generated cookies are appended to the HTTP response, instructing the client's browser to store and automatically send them with subsequent authenticated requests.
*   **Response Construction:** The endpoint constructs the final HTTP `200 OK` response, including the optional `AuthResponse` JSON payload and the `Set-Cookie` headers.

### 5. Dependencies

*   **Request/Response Entities:**
    *   `LoginRequest` (Input DTO)
    *   `AuthResponse` (Output DTO)
    *   `UserDetails` (Interface/Model representing authenticated user information)
*   **Services:**
    *   `AuthService`: Encapsulates authentication business logic.
    *   `UserDetailsService`: Standard Spring Security interface for loading user-specific data.
    *   `CookieService`: Manages the creation and configuration of HTTP cookies.
    *   `JwtTokenProvider`: Handles the generation, signing, and potentially validation of JWTs.
*   **Libraries/Frameworks:**
    *   Spring Boot: Application framework.
    *   Spring Security: Provides authentication and authorization capabilities (e.g., `UserDetailsService`, `PasswordEncoder`).
    *   JJWT (or similar JWT library): For JWT creation and signing.
    *   Jakarta Servlet API (`HttpServletResponse`): For direct manipulation of HTTP response (e.g., adding cookies).
    *   Logging Framework (e.g., SLF4J/Logback): For logging application events and errors.
*   **Database Entities/Tables:**
    *   `User` entity/table: Stores user credentials and profile information, accessed via `UserRepository`.

### 6. Security Features

*   **Password Hashing:** User passwords are never stored in plain text. A strong, one-way hashing algorithm (e.g., BCrypt via `PasswordEncoder`) is used to hash passwords before storage, and to verify them during login, mitigating the risk of credential exposure.
*   **JWT Signing:** Both access and refresh tokens are digitally signed using a secret key (`jwtTokenProvider`). This ensures their integrity and authenticity, preventing tampering by unauthorized parties.
*   **Token Expiration:** Access tokens are designed to be short-lived, minimizing the window of opportunity for misuse if compromised. Refresh tokens are longer-lived but still have an expiration, requiring periodic re-authentication.
*   **HttpOnly Cookies:** The `HttpOnly` flag is set on authentication and refresh token cookies. This prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie's value, significantly reducing the impact of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
*   **Secure Cookies:** The `Secure` flag is set on cookies, ensuring they are only transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections. This protects tokens from eavesdropping during transit, guarding against Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
*   **SameSite Cookies:** The `SameSite` attribute (e.g., `Lax` or `Strict`) is configured on cookies. This helps mitigate Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by controlling when cookies are sent with cross-site requests.
*   **Input Validation:** Robust validation of `LoginRequest` fields helps prevent common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, command injection, and buffer overflows.
*   **CORS Configuration (Implicit):** Assumed to be properly configured at the application level to allow legitimate cross-origin requests while blocking malicious ones.

### 7. Error Handling

*   **Invalid Credentials:** If the provided username and password do not match any registered user or if the password is incorrect, the endpoint returns a `401 Unauthorized` status. The response body may include a specific error message.
*   **User Not Found:** If `userDetailsService.loadUserByUsername` cannot find a user with the given username, it typically throws an exception (e.g., `UsernameNotFoundException` from Spring Security), which is caught and mapped to a `401 Unauthorized` response.
*   **Invalid Input/Bad Request:** If the `LoginRequest` is malformed, missing required fields, or fails validation checks (e.g., empty username/password), a `400 Bad Request` status is returned.
*   **Internal Server Errors:** Any unexpected errors during database operations, token generation, or other internal processes are caught. These typically result in a `500 Internal Server Error` status.
*   **Logging:** All errors (authentication failures, system errors, validation issues) are logged with appropriate severity levels (e.g., WARN, ERROR) to aid in monitoring, debugging, and security auditing.
*   **Standardized Error Response (Assumption):** Errors are likely returned in a consistent JSON format, possibly including a `code`, `message`, and `details` field to help clients understand and handle the error.

### 8. Performance Considerations

*   **Efficient Credential Verification:** The `passwordEncoder.matches` operation is computationally optimized for rapid password comparison.
*   **Optimized Token Generation:** The `jwtTokenProvider` is designed for efficient generation and signing of JWTs, minimizing latency in token issuance.
*   **Minimal Database Operations:** User lookup (`userRepository.findByUsername`) is a single, indexed query, ensuring quick data retrieval.
*   **Cookie Size Optimization:** Efforts are made to keep the size of the authentication cookies minimal to reduce network overhead on every subsequent request.
*   **Metrics Collection (Assumption):** The endpoint is likely integrated with application performance monitoring (APM) tools to collect metrics such as response time, throughput, and error rates, enabling proactive identification and resolution of performance bottlenecks.

### 9. Usage Pattern

*   **Typical Use Case:** This endpoint is the foundational entry point for users to securely access the application. After a user provides their credentials through a client-side login form, the client initiates a `POST` request to this endpoint.
*   **Context:** It is primarily called at the beginning of a user's session, or when a user explicitly attempts to log in.
*   **Prerequisites:**
    *   The user must have a pre-existing account registered in the system.
    *   The client application must collect the user's username and password.
    *   The client must be able to handle `Set-Cookie` headers if it's a browser-based application, or parse the JSON response body if it's a mobile/desktop application.
*   **Subsequent Interaction:** Upon a successful login, the browser automatically manages the `auth_token` and `refresh_token` cookies. These cookies are then automatically sent with all subsequent requests to protected API endpoints, allowing the server to authenticate the user without requiring re-entry of credentials. The `refresh_token` enables silent acquisition of new `auth_token`s once the current one expires.

### 10. Additional Notes

*   **Token Redundancy in Response Body:** While tokens are primarily delivered via HTTP-only cookies for browser clients, returning them in the JSON response body (`AuthResponse`) provides flexibility for non-browser clients (e.g., mobile apps, CLI tools) that may prefer to read tokens directly from the response and manage their storage explicitly.
*   **Rate Limiting:** It is highly recommended to implement rate limiting on this endpoint to prevent brute-force attacks and credential stuffing attempts.
*   **MFA Integration:** This endpoint represents the first factor of authentication. For enhanced security, it can be extended to integrate multi-factor authentication (MFA) as a subsequent step.
*   **Session Management:** The interaction of access tokens and refresh tokens facilitates a stateless session management approach on the server side, improving scalability. The server validates tokens cryptographically without needing to maintain explicit session state.
