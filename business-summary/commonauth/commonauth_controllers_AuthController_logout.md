## API Endpoint Documentation: User Authentication & Token Generation

### 1. Endpoint Overview

*   **Endpoint Path**: `/api/v1/auth/token`
*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Consumes**: `application/json`
*   **Produces**: `application/json`
*   **Purpose**: This endpoint serves as the primary authentication mechanism for users and client applications. It allows users to exchange their credentials (username and password) for secure access and refresh tokens, enabling subsequent authorized access to other API resources.
*   **Controller Method**: `AuthServiceController.generateToken`
*   **Primary Function**: Authenticates user credentials, generates short-lived access tokens (JWTs) for immediate API access, and long-lived refresh tokens (JWTs) for renewing access tokens without re-authentication. It also handles the secure delivery of these tokens via HTTP response body and secure cookies.

### 2. Request and Response

**Request Type**:
The endpoint expects a JSON payload containing user credentials.

*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Content-Type**: `application/json`
*   **Payload Structure (`LoginRequest`)**:
    ```json
    {
      "username": "user.name@example.com",
      "password": "securepassword123"
    }
    ```
    *   `username` (string, required): The user's unique identifier, typically an email address or a specific username.
    *   `password` (string, required): The user's password.

**Response Type**:
Upon successful authentication, the endpoint returns a JSON object containing the generated access and refresh tokens. It also sets a secure HttpOnly cookie for the refresh token and optionally includes the access token in an HTTP header.

*   **Success Response (200 OK)**:
    *   **Status Code**: `200 OK`
    *   **Content-Type**: `application/json`
    *   **Payload Structure (`AuthResponse`)**:
        ```json
        {
          "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsI...",
          "refreshToken": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsI..."
        }
        ```
        *   `accessToken` (string): A short-lived JSON Web Token (JWT) that should be used in the `Authorization: Bearer` header for subsequent API calls to protected resources.
        *   `refreshToken` (string): A longer-lived JSON Web Token (JWT) used to obtain new access tokens once the current one expires. This token is primarily delivered via a secure HTTP-only cookie, but is also included in the body for flexibility in certain client architectures (e.g., mobile apps that manage tokens manually).
    *   **Response Headers**:
        *   `Set-Cookie`: `refresh_token=<refresh_token_value>; Path=/api/v1/auth/refresh; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict; Max-Age=<expires_in_seconds>`
            *   This cookie contains the refresh token and is secured with HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite=Strict flags to enhance security.
        *   `X-Auth-Token`: `<accessToken_value>` (Optional: Provides the access token in a header for direct client access, mirroring the `accessToken` in the JSON body).
*   **Error Responses**:
    *   `400 Bad Request`: If the `LoginRequest` payload is malformed, or if `username` or `password` are missing/empty.
    *   `401 Unauthorized`: If the provided `username` and `password` do not match valid credentials in the system.
    *   `500 Internal Server Error`: For unexpected server-side issues such as database connectivity problems, JWT generation failures, or other unhandled exceptions. Error responses typically follow a standardized format, e.g., JSON with `error_code` and `message`.

### 3. Call Hierarchy

The `AuthServiceController.generateToken` method orchestrates a series of operations to validate credentials, generate tokens, and prepare the response.

*   **`AuthServiceController.generateToken(LoginRequest loginRequest)`**
    *   **Description**: The primary entry point for the API call. It takes the user's login credentials as input and manages the overall authentication and token issuance flow.
    *   **Operations**:
        1.  **Request Validation**:
            *   Performs initial validation on `loginRequest` to ensure `username` and `password` fields are present and well-formed.
        2.  **User Authentication**:
            *   Invokes `authService.authenticate(username, password)`.
                *   **`authService.authenticate(username, password)`**
                    *   **Description**: Handles the core logic of authenticating the user against stored credentials.
                    *   **Operations**:
                        *   Queries the user repository: `userRepository.findByUsername(username)`.
                            *   **Purpose**: Retrieves the user's stored details, including their hashed password.
                        *   Compares passwords: `passwordEncoder.matches(rawPassword, encodedPassword)`.
                            *   **Purpose**: Securely verifies the provided `rawPassword` against the stored `encodedPassword`.
                        *   **Error Handling**: If authentication fails (e.g., user not found, password mismatch), it throws a `BadCredentialsException`.
        3.  **Token Generation (if authentication is successful)**:
            *   Invokes `jwtService.generateAccessToken(username)`.
                *   **`jwtService.generateAccessToken(username)`**
                    *   **Description**: Creates a short-lived JSON Web Token for immediate API authorization.
                    *   **Output**: A signed JWT string (e.g., expires in 15 minutes).
                    *   **Operations**: Builds the JWT payload with claims like `subject` (username) and `expiration` time. Signs the JWT using a configured RSA private key.
            *   Invokes `jwtService.generateRefreshToken(username)`.
                *   **`jwtService.generateRefreshToken(username)`**
                    *   **Description**: Creates a longer-lived JSON Web Token specifically for refreshing access tokens.
                    *   **Output**: A signed JWT string (e.g., expires in 7 days).
                    *   **Operations**: Similar to `generateAccessToken`, but with a longer expiration time. Signs the JWT using the same RSA private key.
        4.  **Refresh Token Persistence**:
            *   Invokes `tokenStoreService.storeRefreshToken(username, refreshToken, ipAddress)`.
                *   **`tokenStoreService.storeRefreshToken(username, refreshToken, ipAddress)`**
                    *   **Description**: Persists the generated refresh token in the database for tracking, validation, and potential revocation.
                    *   **Operations**: Calls `refreshTokenRepository.save(new RefreshTokenEntity(...))` to store details like the token itself (or a hash/ID), associated username, and the client's IP address at the time of issuance.
        5.  **Response Construction**:
            *   Creates an `AuthResponse` object containing both the `accessToken` and `refreshToken`.
            *   Configures HTTP headers (e.g., `X-Auth-Token`) and cookies (`refresh_token`) for the response.
        6.  **Error Handling**:
            *   Contains `try-catch` blocks to gracefully handle exceptions:
                *   `AuthenticationException`: Catches authentication failures (e.g., `BadCredentialsException`) and maps them to a `401 Unauthorized` response.
                *   `DataAccessException`: Catches database-related issues (e.g., during user lookup or refresh token storage) and maps them to a `500 Internal Server Error`.
                *   `JwtGenerationException`: Catches errors during JWT creation/signing and maps them to a `500 Internal Server Error`.

### 4. Key Operations

1.  **Request Validation**: Ensures the incoming `LoginRequest` is complete and properly formatted, preventing processing of invalid or malicious inputs.
2.  **User Authentication**: The critical security gate. It verifies the user's identity by comparing the provided password against a securely stored hashed version.
3.  **Access Token Generation**: Creates a short-lived, cryptographically signed token that proves the user's identity to other API endpoints without requiring repeated authentication.
4.  **Refresh Token Generation**: Creates a long-lived, cryptographically signed token that allows the client to obtain new access tokens without re-entering credentials, enhancing user experience while maintaining security.
5.  **Refresh Token Storage & Management**: Persisting the refresh token on the server side enables its validation, revocation (e.g., on logout), and tracking, crucial for session management.
6.  **Secure Cookie Creation**: The `refresh_token` is specifically delivered via an `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Strict` cookie to protect it from client-side script access (XSS), ensure transmission over HTTPS, and mitigate Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
7.  **HTTP Header Population**: The `X-Auth-Token` header provides the access token directly in the response headers, which can be useful for certain client integrations.

### 5. Dependencies

*   **Request/Response Entities (Data Models)**:
    *   `LoginRequest`: Represents the input credentials.
    *   `AuthResponse`: Represents the output tokens.
    *   `RefreshTokenEntity`: Represents the database schema for storing refresh token details.
*   **Core Services**:
    *   `AuthService`: Encapsulates user authentication logic.
    *   `JwtService`: Manages the creation, signing, and (implicitly, for refresh) validation of JWTs.
    *   `TokenStoreService`: Handles the persistence layer for refresh tokens.
*   **Data Access Repositories**:
    *   `UserRepository`: Provides methods for interacting with the user database (e.g., finding a user by username).
    *   `RefreshTokenRepository`: Provides methods for interacting with the refresh token database (e.g., saving a new refresh token record).
*   **Libraries/Utilities**:
    *   `PasswordEncoder` (e.g., Spring Security's `BCryptPasswordEncoder`): For secure one-way hashing and comparison of passwords.
    *   JWT Library (e.g., `jjwt`): Underlying library responsible for cryptographic operations related to JWTs (signing, parsing).
    *   Spring Security: Provides core authentication and authorization capabilities, including password encoding and potentially exception handling.
    *   Spring Data JPA: Simplifies database interactions with repositories.
    *   Logging Utilities (e.g., SLF4J/Logback): For logging operational information and errors.
*   **Database**:
    *   A database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) containing `users` table (for credentials) and `refresh_tokens` table (for refresh token management).

### 6. Security Features

*   **Password Hashing**: User passwords are never stored in plain text. They are hashed using a strong, one-way algorithm (like BCrypt) via `PasswordEncoder` before storage and during comparison, making them resistant to brute-force attacks and database breaches.
*   **JWT Signing**: Both access and refresh tokens are digitally signed using a robust asymmetric cryptographic algorithm (e.g., RSA with a private key). This ensures the token's integrity (it hasn't been tampered with) and authenticity (it was issued by a trusted server).
*   **Token Expiration**: Access tokens are deliberately short-lived (e.g., 15 minutes). This limits the window of opportunity for an attacker if an access token is compromised. Refresh tokens are longer-lived (e.g., 7 days) but are protected by HttpOnly/Secure cookies and server-side storage.
*   **HttpOnly Cookies for Refresh Token**: The `refresh_token` cookie is marked `HttpOnly`, which prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing it. This significantly mitigates the impact of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   **Secure Cookies**: The `refresh_token` cookie is marked `Secure`, ensuring that it is only transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections. This protects the token from eavesdropping during transit (Man-in-the-Middle attacks).
*   **SameSite=Strict Cookies**: The `refresh_token` cookie is marked `SameSite=Strict`, which prevents the browser from sending the cookie with cross-site requests. This is a powerful defense against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   **Server-Side Refresh Token Storage and Revocation**: Storing refresh token details (or hashes) in the database allows the server to actively validate and revoke tokens. This is crucial for scenarios like user logout, account compromise, or enforcing session limits. The IP address tracking during storage adds an extra layer of security by allowing detection of anomalous usage.
*   **Input Validation**: Basic validation on incoming `LoginRequest` prevents common attack vectors such as injection and ensures data integrity.
*   **Generic Error Messages**: Error responses for authentication failures are kept generic (`Unauthorized`) to avoid leaking sensitive information about why the authentication failed (e.g., "username not found" vs. "incorrect password").
*   **HTTPS Enforcement**: This endpoint, being highly sensitive, is assumed to be deployed only over HTTPS to encrypt all traffic.

### 7. Error Handling

The endpoint is designed with robust error handling to provide clear feedback to clients and maintain system stability.

*   **Invalid Input (`400 Bad Request`)**:
    *   **Trigger**: If the `LoginRequest` payload is malformed, or if required fields like `username` or `password` are missing or empty.
    *   **Behavior**: An appropriate `400 Bad Request` status code is returned, often with a detailed error message indicating which input field caused the issue.
    *   **Logging**: These errors are logged internally at an `INFO` or `WARN` level for monitoring.
*   **Authentication Failures (`401 Unauthorized`)**:
    *   **Trigger**: If the provided `username` and `password` do not match any valid user credentials in the system (e.g., `authService.authenticate` throws `BadCredentialsException`).
    *   **Behavior**: A `401 Unauthorized` status code is returned. The error message is generic (e.g., "Invalid credentials") to prevent credential enumeration attacks.
    *   **Logging**: Authenticated failures are logged internally at a `WARN` level, often without sensitive input data, to monitor suspicious activity.
*   **Internal Server Errors (`500 Internal Server Error`)**:
    *   **Trigger**: For unexpected server-side issues such as:
        *   `DataAccessException`: Problems interacting with the database (e.g., connection issues, invalid queries during user lookup or refresh token storage).
        *   `JwtGenerationException`: Issues during the JWT creation or signing process (e.g., misconfigured keys, internal cryptographic errors).
        *   Any other unhandled runtime exceptions.
    *   **Behavior**: A `500 Internal Server Error` status code is returned. The error message to the client is typically generic (e.g., "An unexpected server error occurred"), while detailed error information (stack traces, specific exceptions) is logged internally.
    *   **Logging**: These critical errors are logged at an `ERROR` level with full stack traces for immediate attention and debugging.
*   **Standardized Error Response**: All error responses typically follow a consistent JSON structure, including fields like `status` (HTTP status code), `error` (a brief description), `message` (a more detailed, user-friendly message), and optionally `timestamp` and `path`.

### 8. Performance Considerations

*   **Efficient Authentication Logic**: The core authentication logic within `authService.authenticate` involves a user lookup (which should leverage database indexing on the username field) and a password comparison using `passwordEncoder`. These operations are optimized for speed.
*   **Optimized JWT Generation**: JWT generation (signing) is a cryptographic operation. The chosen JWT library and signing algorithm are efficient, minimizing the latency added by token creation.
*   **Minimal Database Operations**: The endpoint typically performs a single read operation (user lookup) and a single write operation (refresh token storage). These are generally fast operations.
*   **Compact Response Size**: The response payload (`AuthResponse`) is small, containing only the necessary tokens, which reduces network overhead.
*   **Cookie Size Management**: While cookies add overhead to subsequent requests, the `refresh_token` cookie is kept to a reasonable size to minimize impact.
*   **Scalability**: The design emphasizes statelessness for access tokens, meaning once issued, an access token's validity can be quickly checked without a database lookup, allowing the system to scale horizontally for subsequent API calls. The refresh token mechanism manages longer-lived sessions with minimal database interaction per access token refresh.
*   **Metrics Collection**: (Assumed) The endpoint is typically instrumented with performance monitoring tools to collect metrics like request latency, throughput, and error rates, allowing for real-time performance tracking and alerting.

### 9. Usage Pattern

This endpoint is the critical first step in establishing a secure, authenticated session for a user or client application with the API.

*   **Typical Use Case**:
    1.  **User Login**: A user interacts with a client application (web browser, mobile app, desktop application) and provides their username and password.
    2.  **Initial Authentication Request**: The client application sends a `POST` request to `/api/v1/auth/token` with the user's credentials in the JSON body.
    3.  **Token Reception**: Upon successful authentication, the API responds with:
        *   An `accessToken` in the JSON body (and potentially the `X-Auth-Token` header).
        *   A `refresh_token` set as a secure HttpOnly cookie.
    4.  **Client-Side Token Management**:
        *   The client extracts the `accessToken` from the response body/header. This token is then included in the `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` header for all subsequent API requests to protected resources.
        *   The `refresh_token` cookie is automatically managed by the browser and will be sent with requests to the designated refresh endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/auth/refresh`) when the access token expires.
*   **Prerequisites**:
    *   The client application must have a secure way to collect and transmit user credentials (e.g., via a login form over HTTPS).
    *   The user must have an existing account with valid credentials stored in the system.
*   **Context**: This endpoint is primarily called once at the beginning of a user's session or after a user explicitly logs out and wishes to re-authenticate. It's not typically called for every API request, only for session establishment and renewal.

### 10. Additional Notes

*   **HTTPS is Mandatory**: Given the sensitive nature of credentials and tokens, this endpoint **must** always be accessed over HTTPS to ensure data encryption in transit.
*   **Secure Key Management**: The private key used for signing JWTs is extremely sensitive. It should be securely stored and managed, ideally in a Hardware Security Module (HSM) or a secure key vault, and never exposed in source code or insecure configurations.
*   **Scalability**: The choice of JWTs makes the access token verification stateless, which is highly beneficial for scaling microservices as individual services don't need to query a central session store to validate each access token.
*   **Refresh Token Revocation**: While refresh tokens are long-lived, their server-side storage allows for explicit revocation (e.g., if a user logs out from all devices, if an account is compromised, or if an administrator forces a session termination). The `/api/v1/auth/token` endpoint itself does not handle revocation, but its storage mechanism enables it for other endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/auth/logout`).
*   **IP Address Tracking**: Storing the IP address with the refresh token allows for additional security checks, such as detecting token usage from an unusual or suspicious IP address. This can be used for fraud detection or session hijacking prevention.
