## API Endpoint Documentation: Token Refresh

This document provides a detailed overview of the `/api/v1/auth/refresh` API endpoint, covering its functionality, technical implementation, security aspects, and usage patterns.

---

### 1. Endpoint Overview

*   **Endpoint Path**: `/api/v1/auth/refresh`
*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Consumes**: `application/json` (primarily for consistency, though input is mainly from cookies)
*   **Produces**: `application/json`
*   **Purpose**: This endpoint is designed to securely renew a user's access token and refresh token without requiring a full re-authentication (e.g., username/password submission). It's crucial for maintaining user sessions and enhancing security by regularly rotating short-lived access tokens.
*   **Controller Method**: `AuthRestController.refreshAccessToken`
*   **Primary Function**: Validates an existing refresh token (received via a secure cookie), generates new access and refresh tokens, and sets them as secure, HttpOnly cookies in the client's browser.

### 2. Request and Response

**Request Type**:

*   **Input Parameters**: This endpoint primarily relies on a valid `refreshToken` supplied via an HTTP cookie.
    *   **Cookie**: `refreshToken` (required) - An HttpOnly, Secure cookie containing the JWT refresh token issued during initial login or a previous refresh.
*   **Payload Structure**: While the endpoint *consumes* `application/json` for API consistency, a request body is typically not required or processed for this cookie-driven refresh flow. An empty JSON object `{}` might be sent, or no body at all.

**Response Type**:

*   **Success Response (200 OK)**:
    *   **Status Code**: `200 OK`
    *   **Payload**: An empty JSON object `{}`. The primary output of this endpoint is delivered via HTTP cookies, not the response body, for enhanced security (preventing client-side JavaScript access to tokens).
    *   **Headers**:
        *   `Set-Cookie`: Two `Set-Cookie` headers will be present to set the new `accessToken` and `refreshToken`.
            *   `accessToken`: Contains the newly generated short-lived access token.
            *   `refreshToken`: Contains the newly generated long-lived refresh token.
    *   **Cookies**: Both new cookies will be configured with the following flags for maximum security:
        *   `HttpOnly`: Prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie value, mitigating XSS attacks.
        *   `Secure`: Ensures the cookie is only sent over HTTPS connections.
        *   `SameSite=Lax` (or `Strict`): Provides protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
        *   `Path`: Specifies the URL path for which the cookie is valid (e.g., `/` for the entire domain).
        *   `Expires`/`Max-Age`: Defines the cookie's expiration time.

*   **Error Response**: (See Section 7: Error Handling for detailed structure)
    *   Typically `401 Unauthorized` for invalid/expired tokens or `400 Bad Request` for malformed input.
    *   Payload will contain an error message and code.

### 3. Call Hierarchy

The `refreshAccessToken` endpoint orchestrates a series of calls to various services and utilities to perform its function:

1.  **`AuthRestController.refreshAccessToken(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)`**
    *   **Role**: Entry point; coordinates the token refresh process.
    *   **Key Operations**: Delegates token extraction, validation, generation, and cookie management.
    *   **Invokes**:
        *   **`SecurityUtils.extractRefreshTokenFromCookie(request)`**
            *   **Role**: Utility to safely extract the refresh token from the incoming HTTP request's cookies.
            *   **Input**: `HttpServletRequest` object.
            *   **Internal Operations**:
                *   Calls `HttpServletRequest.getCookies()` to retrieve all cookies.
                *   Iterates through cookies to find the one named `refreshToken`.
                *   Extracts `Cookie.getName()` and `Cookie.getValue()`.
            *   **Output**: The refresh token string, or `null` if not found.
        *   **`AuthTokenService.validateAndRefreshTokens(refreshToken)`**
            *   **Role**: Core business logic service responsible for token validation and generation.
            *   **Input**: The extracted `refreshToken` string.
            *   **Internal Operations**:
                *   **`JwtTokenProvider.validateRefreshToken(refreshToken)`**
                    *   **Role**: Validates the cryptographic signature and expiration of the refresh token.
                    *   **Internal Operations**: Uses a JWT library (`Jwts.parser().setSigningKey().parseClaimsJws(token)`) to parse and verify the token against a known signing key. If valid, extracts claims (e.g., subject/username).
                    *   **Output**: JWT Claims (e.g., user identifier).
                *   **`UserDetailsService.loadUserByUsername(claims.getSubject())`**
                    *   **Role**: Retrieves detailed user information based on the username extracted from the refresh token's claims.
                    *   **Internal Operations**:
                        *   **`UserRepository.findByUsername(username)`**: Database query to find the user entity.
                    *   **Output**: `UserDetails` object (containing user roles, enabled status, etc.).
                *   **`JwtTokenProvider.generateAccessToken(userDetails)`**
                    *   **Role**: Creates a new, short-lived JWT access token for the authenticated user.
                    *   **Internal Operations**: Uses a JWT library (`Jwts.builder().setSubject().signWith().compact()`) to build the token, signing it with the application's secret key.
                    *   **Output**: New access token string.
                *   **`JwtTokenProvider.generateRefreshToken(userDetails)`**
                    *   **Role**: Creates a new, long-lived JWT refresh token. This typically implies refresh token rotation (issuing a new refresh token with each refresh request).
                    *   **Internal Operations**: Similar to access token generation, but often with a longer expiry and a different signing key or audience.
                    *   **Output**: New refresh token string.
                *   **`RefreshTokenRepository.save(new RefreshTokenEntity(refreshTokenHash))`**
                    *   **Role**: Persists the new refresh token (often its hash) in a database. This is crucial for tracking issued tokens and enabling server-side revocation.
                    *   **Input**: A `RefreshTokenEntity` representing the new token.
                    *   **Output**: Saved `RefreshTokenEntity`.
            *   **Output**: A data structure containing the newly generated `accessToken` and `refreshToken` strings.
        *   **`CookieUtils.addCookie(response, accessTokenCookieName, accessToken, accessTokenExpiry)`**
            *   **Role**: Helper to construct and add the new access token cookie to the HTTP response.
            *   **Input**: `HttpServletResponse`, cookie name, token value, expiry duration.
            *   **Internal Operations**:
                *   **`Cookie.builder().name().value().path().httpOnly().secure().sameSite().build()`**: Builds the cookie object with secure attributes.
                *   **`HttpServletResponse.addCookie()`**: Adds the prepared cookie to the response.
        *   **`CookieUtils.addCookie(response, refreshTokenCookieName, refreshToken, refreshTokenExpiry)`**
            *   **Role**: Helper to construct and add the new refresh token cookie to the HTTP response. (Identical operations as above, but for the refresh token).
        *   **`HttpServletResponse.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_OK)`**
            *   **Role**: Explicitly sets the HTTP status code to 200 (OK).
        *   **`ResponseEntity.ok().build()`**
            *   **Role**: Constructs and returns an empty 200 OK HTTP response.

### 4. Key Operations

The primary operations performed by the `/api/v1/auth/refresh` endpoint are:

*   **Refresh Token Extraction**: Safely retrieves the refresh token from the incoming HTTP request cookies.
*   **Refresh Token Validation**: Verifies the integrity, authenticity, and expiration of the provided refresh token using cryptographic signatures and JWT claims. This is a critical security step.
*   **User Details Retrieval**: Fetches the associated user's details from the database based on the subject (username) found in the valid refresh token.
*   **New Access Token Generation**: Creates a fresh, short-lived JWT access token, typically with a new expiry time.
*   **New Refresh Token Generation (Rotation)**: Generates a new refresh token. This "rotation" mechanism enhances security by making each refresh token a single-use token, further mitigating risks if a token is compromised.
*   **Refresh Token Persistence**: Stores the newly generated refresh token (or its hashed value) in a database to enable server-side tracking and potential invalidation/revocation.
*   **Secure Cookie Management**: Constructs and attaches new `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` cookies for both the access token and the refresh token to the HTTP response. This is how tokens are securely transmitted to the client.

### 5. Dependencies

This endpoint relies on several components and libraries:

*   **Request/Response Entities**:
    *   `HttpServletRequest`, `HttpServletResponse` (Servlet API for handling HTTP requests/responses)
    *   `Cookie` (Servlet API for HTTP cookies)
    *   `RefreshTokenEntity` (Custom data model for persisting refresh tokens in the database)
    *   `UserDetails` (Spring Security interface for user details)
*   **Services/Repositories**:
    *   `AuthTokenService`: Business logic for token validation and refresh.
    *   `JwtTokenProvider`: Utility for JWT token generation and validation.
    *   `UserDetailsService`: Spring Security interface for loading user-specific data.
    *   `UserRepository`: Data Access Object (DAO) for user database operations.
    *   `RefreshTokenRepository`: DAO for refresh token database operations.
    *   `SecurityUtils`: Custom utility for security-related helper functions (e.g., cookie extraction).
    *   `CookieUtils`: Custom utility for creating and managing secure cookies.
*   **Libraries/Frameworks**:
    *   **Spring Framework**: Core framework for REST controllers, dependency injection, and HTTP handling.
    *   **Spring Security**: For authentication/authorization context, `UserDetails`, and potentially CSRF protection.
    *   **JJWT (Java JWT)**: Library for JSON Web Token creation, parsing, and validation.
    *   **JPA/Hibernate**: For database interaction via `UserRepository` and `RefreshTokenRepository`.
    *   **SLF4J/Logback**: For logging purposes.

### 6. Security Features

The endpoint incorporates several robust security measures:

*   **JWT Security**:
    *   **Digital Signatures**: All JWTs (access and refresh tokens) are cryptographically signed using a strong secret key, ensuring their authenticity and integrity. Any tampering is detectable.
    *   **Expiration Times**: Both access and refresh tokens have defined expiration times, limiting the window of opportunity for token misuse if compromised.
*   **Cookie Security**:
    *   **`HttpOnly` Flag**: Both the `accessToken` and `refreshToken` cookies are marked `HttpOnly`. This prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie value, making it extremely difficult for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks to steal tokens.
    *   **`Secure` Flag**: Cookies are marked `Secure`, meaning they will only be sent over encrypted HTTPS connections. This prevents eavesdropping on tokens during transit.
    *   **`SameSite` Policy (`Lax` or `Strict`)**: This attribute protects against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by controlling when cookies are sent with cross-site requests. `Lax` allows cookies for top-level navigations (e.g., clicking a link), while `Strict` only sends cookies for same-site requests.
*   **Token Revocation/Persistence**: By persisting refresh tokens (or their hashes) in a database via `RefreshTokenRepository`, the system gains the ability to:
    *   **Revoke Tokens**: Invalidate compromised or unwanted refresh tokens before their natural expiry.
    *   **Track Usage**: Monitor refresh token activity.
    *   **Limit Concurrent Sessions**: If designed to do so, enforce limits on how many active refresh tokens a user can have.
*   **Refresh Token Rotation**: Issuing a new refresh token with each successful refresh request reduces the lifespan of any single refresh token, limiting its usefulness if intercepted. The old refresh token is typically invalidated.
*   **Input Validation**: While not explicitly shown in the call hierarchy, the `JwtTokenProvider.validateRefreshToken` implicitly validates the token's format, signature, and claims, rejecting malformed or invalid tokens early.

### 7. Error Handling

Error handling within this endpoint is designed to provide clear feedback to the client while logging internal issues for debugging.

*   **Types of Errors Handled**:
    *   **Invalid/Expired Refresh Token**: If the `refreshToken` is missing, malformed, its signature is invalid, or it has expired.
    *   **User Not Found**: If the user identified by the refresh token's subject (username) no longer exists in the system.
    *   **Database Errors**: Issues during user lookup or refresh token persistence.
    *   **Internal Server Errors**: Unexpected exceptions (e.g., misconfigured JWT keys, service unavailability).
*   **Error Logging**: All significant errors are logged internally (e.g., using SLF4J/Logback) with relevant details (stack traces, error messages) to aid in troubleshooting and monitoring.
*   **Client Response**:
    *   For authentication-related failures (invalid token, user not found), the API typically returns a `401 Unauthorized` or `400 Bad Request` HTTP status code.
    *   For internal server issues, a `500 Internal Server Error` is returned.
    *   **Error Response Structure (Example)**:
        ```json
        {
          "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:30:00.000Z",
          "status": 401,
          "error": "Unauthorized",
          "message": "Invalid or expired refresh token. Please log in again.",
          "path": "/api/v1/auth/refresh",
          "errorCode": "AUTH_001"
        }
        ```
        (Note: The specific `errorCode` and message structure can vary.)

### 8. Performance Considerations

The endpoint is designed with performance in mind:

*   **Efficient JWT Operations**: JWT generation and validation are optimized cryptographic operations. Key management is typically in-memory, leading to fast signature checks.
*   **Optimized Database Lookups**: User and refresh token lookups are typically performed using indexed database columns (e.g., `username`, `refreshTokenHash`), ensuring quick retrieval times.
*   **Minimal Payload Size**: The success response returns an empty JSON object, minimizing network overhead. Tokens are transferred efficiently via HTTP headers (cookies).
*   **Metrics Collection**: While not explicitly in the hierarchy, an expert system would typically integrate performance metrics (e.g., using Micrometer/Prometheus) to monitor:
    *   Endpoint response times.
    *   Latency of database operations.
    *   Success/failure rates.
    *   This allows for proactive identification and resolution of performance bottlenecks.

### 9. Usage Pattern

This endpoint is a cornerstone of modern, secure authentication flows:

*   **Typical Use Case**: It is invoked by client applications (e.g., Single-Page Applications, mobile apps) when their short-lived access token expires. Instead of prompting the user to re-enter credentials, the client uses the `refreshToken` (which has a longer lifespan) to silently obtain a new `accessToken` and a fresh `refreshToken`.
*   **Context**: The `refreshToken` is typically obtained during an initial successful login (e.g., via a `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint) where username/password credentials are exchanged for tokens and secure cookies.
*   **Prerequisites**: The client must possess a valid, unexpired, and unrevoked `refreshToken` cookie set in its browser/storage, which will be automatically sent with the `POST` request to this endpoint.
*   **Goal**: To provide a seamless user experience by avoiding frequent re-login prompts while maintaining high security by regularly rotating tokens. If the refresh token also expires or is revoked, the user will be forced to log in again.

### 10. Additional Notes

*   **Refresh Token Revocation**: For enhanced security, it's highly recommended to implement a mechanism for users or administrators to explicitly revoke refresh tokens (e.g., "log out of all devices" functionality). This would typically involve marking the token as invalid in the `RefreshTokenRepository`.
*   **Single-Use Refresh Tokens**: The "rotation" aspect (issuing a new refresh token with each refresh) implies that each refresh token should ideally be single-use. If a refresh token is reused, it could indicate an attempt to exploit a compromised token. The system might invalidate both the old and new token in such a scenario.
*   **Assumption**: The `RefreshTokenRepository` stores a hashed version of the refresh token, not the plain token itself, to prevent exposure in case of a database breach.
*   **CORS Configuration**: Proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration is essential if the frontend application is hosted on a different domain/port than the API. This endpoint will need to be explicitly allowed in the CORS policy.
