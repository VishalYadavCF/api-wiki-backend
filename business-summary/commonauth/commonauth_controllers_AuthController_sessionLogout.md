### API Endpoint Documentation: Generate Authentication Token

#### 1. Endpoint Overview

*   **Endpoint Path**: `/auth/token`
*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Consumes**: `application/json`
*   **Produces**: `application/json`
*   **Purpose**: This endpoint facilitates the secure generation of authentication tokens (specifically, a JSON Web Token - JWT) and the creation of an accompanying secure HTTP-only cookie after successful external authentication. It is primarily used to establish an authenticated session for users who have just completed an authentication flow with an external identity provider.
*   **Controller Method**: `AuthnController.generateToken()`
*   **Primary Function**: To validate incoming authentication requests, authenticate with an external identity provider, manage user records (create if new, retrieve if existing), issue a signed JWT, and set a secure authentication cookie.

#### 2. Request and Response

*   **Request Type**:
    *   **Method**: `POST`
    *   **Headers**: `Content-Type: application/json`
    *   **Payload Structure**:
        ```json
        {
          "externalId": "string",  // Unique identifier from the external authentication system (e.g., Google ID, social security number hash).
          "authCode": "string",    // An authorization code received from the external authentication provider, used to verify the user's identity.
          "state": "string"      // (Optional) A state parameter to maintain state between the request and the callback, protecting against CSRF.
        }
        ```
    *   **Input Parameters**: `externalId` and `authCode` are mandatory. `state` is optional but recommended for security.

*   **Response Type**:
    *   **Success Response (200 OK)**:
        *   **Status Code**: `200 OK`
        *   **Headers**:
            *   `Content-Type: application/json`
            *   `Set-Cookie`: `auth_token=jwt_token_string; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Max-Age=3600` (example cookie details)
        *   **Payload Structure**:
            ```json
            {
              "accessToken": "string", // The generated JWT (also set as an HttpOnly cookie).
              "tokenType": "Bearer",
              "expiresIn": 3600        // Token expiration in seconds.
            }
            ```
        *   **Cookies**: A single `auth_token` cookie is set, containing the JWT. This cookie is marked `HttpOnly` (inaccessible via client-side scripts), `Secure` (sent only over HTTPS), and `SameSite=Lax` (provides protection against some CSRF attacks).

#### 3. Call Hierarchy

The `generateToken` endpoint orchestrates a sequence of operations involving several internal services. The flow ensures secure validation, external authentication, user management, and token issuance.

*   `AuthnController.generateToken(String externalId, String authCode, String state)`
    *   Handles the initial HTTP request, extracts parameters, and manages the overall flow.
    *   Invokes `RequestValidationService` for input integrity checks.
    *   Calls `ExternalAuthnService` to verify the external authentication.
    *   Interacts with `UserService` to manage user persistence.
    *   Delegates to `TokenService` for JWT creation.
    *   Utilizes `CookieService` for setting the authentication cookie.
    *   Logs success and constructs the final HTTP response.

#### 4. Key Operations

1.  **Request Validation**: Ensures that all incoming request parameters (`externalId`, `authCode`, `state`) are present, properly formatted, and sanitized to prevent common web vulnerabilities like injection attacks.
2.  **External Authentication**: Verifies the authenticity of the `authCode` with the configured external identity provider. This is a critical step that establishes the user's trust.
3.  **User Management**: Integrates with the application's user database. It intelligently identifies whether the authenticating user is new (and creates a record) or existing (and retrieves their profile), ensuring consistent user data across systems.
4.  **Token Generation**: Creates a cryptographically signed JWT. This token encapsulates the user's identity and permissions, serving as the primary credential for subsequent API calls.
5.  **Cookie Management**: Constructs a highly secure HTTP-only cookie to deliver the JWT to the client. This method of delivery enhances security by making the token inaccessible to client-side JavaScript, significantly reducing XSS attack vectors.
6.  **Response Formatting**: Structures the successful API response, including the token in the JSON body and setting the authentication cookie in the HTTP headers.

#### 6. Security Features

*   **Input Validation & Sanitization**: All incoming parameters are rigorously validated and sanitized by `RequestValidationService` to prevent common injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection) and ensure data integrity.
*   **Secure External Authentication**: The endpoint relies on a secure communication channel (HTTPS) to the external identity provider and validates the `authCode` to prevent impersonation.
*   **JWT Security**:
    *   **Signed Tokens**: JWTs are signed using a strong cryptographic algorithm (e.g., HS256, RS256) and a securely managed secret key, ensuring their integrity and authenticity.
    *   **Expiration**: Tokens are issued with a limited lifespan (`expiresIn`), forcing re-authentication or token refresh and reducing the window for compromise if a token is stolen.
    *   **Audience/Issuer Claims**: (Implicitly) JWTs are generated with appropriate audience and issuer claims, allowing downstream services to verify the token's intended recipient and origin.
*   **Cookie Security**:
    *   **`HttpOnly`**: The `auth_token` cookie is marked `HttpOnly`, preventing client-side JavaScript from accessing it. This significantly mitigates Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
    *   **`Secure`**: The cookie is marked `Secure`, ensuring it is only transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections, protecting against eavesdropping.
    *   **`SameSite=Lax`**: The `SameSite` attribute helps protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by restricting when the browser sends the cookie with cross-site requests. `Lax` provides a good balance between security and usability.
*   **CSRF Protection (via `state`)**: The optional `state` parameter, when used in conjunction with the external authentication flow, helps prevent CSRF attacks by ensuring that the callback matches the initial request.

#### 7. Error Handling

*   **Granular Exception Handling**: The endpoint employs specific custom exceptions (e.g., `ValidationException`, `ExternalAuthnException`) to differentiate between various types of errors.
*   **Logging**: Errors are comprehensively logged (e.g., `Logger.error()`) with sufficient context (stack traces, relevant input parameters where safe) to aid in debugging and monitoring. This includes failures in validation, external service calls, or database operations.
*   **Client-Friendly Error Responses**: In case of an error, the API returns appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., `400 Bad Request` for validation errors, `401 Unauthorized` for authentication failures, `500 Internal Server Error` for unexpected system issues).
*   **Error Response Structure**: While not explicitly detailed, a standard error response structure is typically returned (e.g., `{"errorCode": "AUTH_FAILED", "message": "Invalid authentication code provided."}`).
*   **No Sensitive Information Disclosure**: Error messages returned to the client are generic and do not expose sensitive internal system details or database errors.

#### 8. Performance Considerations

*   **Efficient External Calls**: The interaction with the external authentication service is a critical path. The `ExternalHttpClient` should be configured for efficient connection pooling and timeouts to prevent bottlenecks.
*   **Optimized Database Operations**: `UserRepository.findByExternalId` should leverage database indexing on `externalId` for fast lookups. `UserRepository.save` is optimized for quick writes.
*   **Minimal Overhead**: JWT generation and cookie creation are generally fast operations. Cookie size is kept minimal to reduce network overhead.
*   **Logging Performance**: Asynchronous logging (if configured) minimizes the impact of logging on request latency.
*   **Metrics Collection**: (Implicit) The endpoint is likely integrated with a metrics collection system (e.g., Prometheus, Micrometer) to monitor response times, error rates, and throughput, enabling proactive performance tuning.

#### 9. Usage Pattern

This endpoint is typically invoked immediately after a user has successfully completed an authentication process with an external identity provider (e.g., Google, Facebook, Okta, Auth0).

1.  **Prerequisite**: The client application must first redirect the user to the external identity provider's authentication page.
2.  **External Callback**: After successful authentication, the external provider redirects the user back to a pre-configured callback URL on the client application, providing an `authCode` and `externalId` (and optionally `state`).
3.  **Token Request**: The client application (e.g., web frontend, mobile app) then makes a `POST` request to this `/auth/token` endpoint, sending the `externalId`, `authCode`, and `state` it received from the external provider.
4.  **Session Establishment**: Upon a successful response, the client receives the JWT in the response body and, more importantly, an `HttpOnly` `auth_token` cookie is set by the browser. Subsequent API calls from the client will automatically include this cookie for authentication.

It acts as a secure bridge, translating an external authentication event into an internal, session-based authentication mechanism for the application.

#### 10. Additional Notes

*   **External Provider Configuration**: This endpoint's functionality heavily depends on the correct configuration of the external identity provider's client ID, client secret, redirect URIs, and token exchange endpoints.
*   **JWT Secret Management**: The `secretKey` used for signing JWTs must be securely managed (e.g., via environment variables, secret management services) and rotated periodically.
*   **Scalability**: The design, with distinct services for validation, external calls, user management, and token generation, promotes modularity and allows for independent scaling of components.
*   **Auditing**: Comprehensive logging ensures that all token generation attempts, including failures, are recorded for security auditing and compliance.
