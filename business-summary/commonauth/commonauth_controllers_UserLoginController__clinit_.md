### API Endpoint Documentation: User Authentication & Token Generation

This document provides a detailed overview of the `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint, covering its functionality, operational flow, security aspects, and usage.

---

#### 1. Endpoint Overview

*   **Endpoint Path**: `/api/v1/auth/login`
*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Consumes**: `application/json`
*   **Produces**: `application/json`
*   **Purpose**: This endpoint facilitates user authentication by validating provided credentials and, upon successful verification, issues secure authentication tokens (Access Token and Refresh Token) to the client. It is the primary entry point for users to establish a session and gain authorization to access protected resources within the system.
*   **Controller Method Name**: `AuthController.login`
*   **Primary Function**: To authenticate a user based on their username and password, generate a short-lived access token and a long-lived refresh token, and securely deliver these tokens to the client for subsequent API interactions.

#### 2. Request and Response

**Request Type**:
The endpoint expects a JSON payload containing user credentials.

*   **HTTP Header**: `Content-Type: application/json`
*   **Payload Structure (JSON)**:
    ```json
    {
      "username": "string",  // The user's registered username (e.g., email address or unique ID)
      "password": "string"   // The user's password
    }
    ```
    *   **Constraints**: Both `username` and `password` are required and must conform to system-defined validation rules (e.g., length, character sets).

**Response Type**:
Upon successful authentication, the endpoint returns an HTTP 200 OK status with a JSON payload containing the access token and relevant metadata. A secure, HttpOnly cookie containing the refresh token is also set in the response headers.

*   **HTTP Status Code (Success)**: `200 OK`
*   **Payload Structure (JSON)**:
    ```json
    {
      "accessToken": "string",       // The JWT Access Token for authenticating subsequent requests
      "tokenType": "Bearer",         // Indicates the token type (standard for JWTs)
      "expiresIn": 3600              // Lifetime of the access token in seconds (e.g., 1 hour)
    }
    ```
*   **HTTP Headers (Success)**:
    *   `Content-Type: application/json`
    *   `Set-Cookie: refresh_token=<refresh_token_value>; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Max-Age=<expiration_in_seconds>`
        *   This header delivers the refresh token as a secure cookie, ensuring it's not accessible via client-side JavaScript.

#### 4. Key Operations

The endpoint performs several critical operations to manage user authentication and token issuance:

*   **Request Validation**: Ensures the incoming `LoginRequest` is well-formed and contains valid data, preventing malformed requests and potential security vulnerabilities.
*   **User Authentication**: Verifies the provided username and password against the system's user store. This includes securely hashing and comparing passwords.
*   **Access Token Generation**: Creates a short-lived JSON Web Token (JWT) that grants access to protected resources. This token includes user-specific claims like user ID and roles, and is digitally signed for integrity.
*   **Refresh Token Generation & Persistence**: Generates a long-lived refresh token which is saved to the database. This token is used to acquire new access tokens without requiring the user to re-enter credentials. Expired refresh tokens are also cleaned up.
*   **Secure Cookie Management**: The refresh token is delivered via a secure, HttpOnly cookie. This protects the token from client-side JavaScript access and prevents Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks from stealing the token.
*   **Login Auditing**: Logs successful login events, providing an audit trail crucial for security monitoring, anomaly detection, and compliance.
*   **Response Construction**: Formats and returns the appropriate HTTP response, including the access token in the JSON body and the refresh token in a secure cookie.

#### 5. Dependencies

This endpoint relies on several key components and entities:

*   **Request/Response Entities**:
    *   `LoginRequest` (DTO): Represents the incoming JSON payload for login.
    *   `LoginResponse` (DTO): Represents the outgoing JSON payload containing the access token.
    *   `AuthenticatedUser` (Internal Model): Represents the successfully authenticated user's details.
*   **Services**:
    *   `ValidationService`: For input validation.
    *   `AuthService`: Encapsulates core authentication logic.
    *   `TokenService`: Handles access and refresh token generation.
    *   `AuditService`: For logging security-related events.
*   **Libraries/Utilities**:
    *   `UserRepository`: Data access layer for user information.
    *   `PasswordEncoder`: For secure password hashing and comparison (e.g., BCryptPasswordEncoder from Spring Security).
    *   `JwtTokenProvider`: A utility or component specifically for creating and signing JWTs (e.g., leveraging `jjwt` library).
    *   `RefreshTokenRepository`: Data access layer for refresh tokens.
    *   `CookieUtil`: A helper utility for creating and managing secure HTTP cookies.
*   **Database Entities/Tables**:
    *   `Users`: Table storing user details, including hashed passwords and roles.
    *   `RefreshTokens`: Table storing refresh tokens, their associated user IDs, and expiration dates.
*   **Frameworks**:
    *   Spring Framework: Provides the MVC capabilities for the REST endpoint.
    *   Spring Security: Likely provides the authentication framework, `PasswordEncoder`, and potentially integrates with `AuthService`.

#### 6. Security Features

The endpoint incorporates robust security measures to protect user credentials and tokens:

*   **Password Hashing**: Passwords are never stored in plain text. `PasswordEncoder` is used to hash passwords before storage and to securely compare them during authentication (e.g., using BCrypt or Argon2), protecting against data breaches.
*   **JWT Security**:
    *   **Digital Signing**: Access Tokens are JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) that are digitally signed using a strong cryptographic algorithm (e.g., HS256 or RS256). This ensures the token's integrity and authenticity, preventing tampering.
    *   **Expiration**: Access tokens are short-lived (`expiresIn`). This minimizes the window of opportunity for an attacker if a token is compromised.
*   **Cookie Security**: The refresh token is delivered via an `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` cookie:
    *   `HttpOnly`: Prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie, mitigating XSS attacks.
    *   `Secure`: Ensures the cookie is only sent over HTTPS (encrypted connections), protecting it from interception during transit.
    *   `SameSite=Lax` (or `Strict`): Provides protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by controlling when the browser sends the cookie with cross-site requests.
*   **Input Validation**: `ValidationService` performs strict validation on all incoming request parameters, preventing common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection by rejecting malformed or malicious input.
*   **Login Auditing**: Successful login attempts are logged, providing a critical audit trail for security monitoring, detecting suspicious activity, and forensic analysis.
*   **Token Rotation/Cleanup**: The `RefreshTokenRepository.cleanupExpiredTokens()` operation ensures that stale or expired refresh tokens are removed from the database, reducing the surface area for token reuse attacks.

#### 7. Error Handling

The endpoint is designed to gracefully handle various error scenarios and provide meaningful feedback to the client:

*   **Input Validation Errors**: If the `LoginRequest` is malformed or contains invalid data (e.g., missing fields, incorrect format), `ValidationService` will throw an exception. This typically results in an `HTTP 400 Bad Request` response, often with a detailed error message indicating which fields are problematic.
*   **Authentication Failures**: If the provided username and password do not match a valid user or are incorrect, `AuthService.authenticateUser` will throw an `AuthenticationException`. This leads to an `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` response, usually with a generic "Invalid credentials" message to prevent username enumeration attacks.
*   **Internal Server Errors**: Any unexpected errors during token generation, database operations (e.g., database connection issues, unique constraint violations for refresh tokens), or other internal processes will be caught. These scenarios typically result in an `HTTP 500 Internal Server Error`.
*   **Error Logging**: All errors (validation, authentication, and internal) are logged internally using `AuditService` or a dedicated logging framework (e.g., SLF4J), providing developers with detailed information for debugging and monitoring.
*   **Error Response Structure**: For client-facing errors, responses typically follow a standardized JSON error format:
    ```json
    {
      "timestamp": "ISO_DATE_TIME",
      "status": 400,
      "error": "Bad Request",
      "message": "Validation failed: Username is required."
    }
    ```
    (Or similar, depending on the system's global error handling strategy).

#### 8. Performance Considerations

The endpoint is designed with performance in mind to ensure a responsive user experience:

*   **Efficient Database Operations**:
    *   `UserRepository.findByUsername`: Should leverage database indexing on the `username` field for quick lookups.
    *   `RefreshTokenRepository.save`: Efficient insertion of new tokens.
    *   `RefreshTokenRepository.cleanupExpiredTokens()`: While important for hygiene, its implementation should be optimized (e.g., batch deletion, running periodically as a background job if not critical to the immediate response path) to avoid impacting the login latency.
*   **Optimized Token Generation**: JWT generation and signing (`JwtTokenProvider.createJwt`) is typically a fast cryptographic operation.
*   **Minimization of Overhead**:
    *   **Cookie Size**: The refresh token is kept concise to minimize HTTP header size.
    *   **Response Time**: The entire call chain is designed to be efficient, aiming for sub-100ms response times for typical loads.
*   **Metrics Collection**: It is highly probable that performance metrics (e.g., response time, error rate, throughput) are collected for this critical endpoint. This allows for real-time monitoring and proactive identification of performance bottlenecks.

#### 9. Usage Pattern

This endpoint is the initial step in the user authentication flow for clients that require a secure, token-based session.

*   **Typical Use Case**:
    1.  A user navigates to the application's login page.
    2.  The user enters their username and password.
    3.  The client-side application makes a `POST` request to `/api/v1/auth/login` with the credentials in the request body.
    4.  Upon successful authentication, the server responds with the access token in the JSON body and sets the refresh token as a secure HttpOnly cookie in the browser.
    5.  The client-side application then uses the received `accessToken` in the `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` header for all subsequent protected API calls.
    6.  When the `accessToken` expires, the client can implicitly or explicitly trigger a refresh mechanism (e.g., by sending a request to a `/auth/refresh` endpoint), which will utilize the `refreshToken` cookie to obtain a new access token without re-authenticating the user.
*   **Prerequisites**:
    *   The user must have a pre-registered account in the system with a valid username and password.
    *   The client application must be configured to send `application/json` payloads and to properly handle and store both the JSON response (access token) and the `Set-Cookie` header (refresh token).
    *   CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies must be correctly configured on the server if the client application is hosted on a different domain.

#### 10. Additional Notes

*   **Token Expiration Strategy**: The access token has a short lifespan (e.g., 1 hour) to reduce the risk of compromise, while the refresh token has a much longer lifespan (e.g., several days or weeks) to provide a convenient user experience without frequent re-logins.
*   **Refresh Token Management**: The system typically expects the refresh token to be managed by the browser (via HttpOnly cookie) and used implicitly by the client for token renewal. For non-browser clients (e.g., mobile apps), the refresh token might be stored securely on the device.
*   **Stateless Access Tokens**: The generated JWT access tokens are typically stateless. This means the server does not need to store session information for them, simplifying scaling and reducing database load for subsequent authenticated requests.
*   **Scalability**: The design, particularly the use of JWTs and a separate refresh token mechanism, supports high scalability by allowing multiple API instances to validate tokens without shared session state.
